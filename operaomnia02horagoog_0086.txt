CARMINUM I. 27.

ΝΑτιε in usum laetitiae scyphis
Pugnare Thracum est: tollite barbarum
Morem, verecundumque Bacchum
Sanguineis prohibete rixis!
Vino et lucernis Medus acinaces 5
Immane qua⁸ntum disc-repat : impium
Lenite clamorem, sodaleS,
Et cubito remanete presso!
Voltis severi me quoque sumere

Partem Falerni? Dicat Opuntiae

lo

Frater Megillae quo beatus
volnere, qua pereat sagitta.

Cessat voluntas?
Mercede.

Non alia bibam
Quae te cunque domat Venus
Non erubescendis adurit

15

Ignibus ingenuoque semper
Amore peccas Quidquid habes age

Depone tutis auribus,

Ah miser,

Quanta laborabas Charybdi,

Digne puer meliore flamma ἔ

20

Quae saga, quis te solvere Thessalis
Magus venenis, quis poterit deus?
Vix illigatum te triformi
Pegasus expediet Ch‘gnaera.

3. verecundum] In Epod. xi. 13 he

is called ⁴ inverecundum,' and Bentley pro-

that word here. But the mes are
different. and the MSS. are unanimous.

5. Vino et lucen-aie] In· prose these
datives would be expresscd by the ablativo
ι with ‘ a.' The same construction in Horace
are ⁴ dissidens plebi! C. ii. 2. 18: ‘⁴ medio
ne discrepet imum,’' A. P. 152.

acinaces] This word, which signifles the
Persian scimitar or short sword, appears to
have been introduced into Greece after tho
Persian vars. It is commonly used by Hero.
dotans. Horace seems to have been the first
latin writer that employed it.—Horace says
qnarrelling is vastly unsuited to those
jovial meetings which are kept up to a late
honr—⁴ vino et lucernis.' 'I'he Romans sat
down to table seldom later than three or four
o’clock, and commonly continued there till
past midnight.

6. Immone quantum] This form is imi-
tated from the Greek: οὐράνιον ὅσον,
θαυμαστὸν ὅσον, ἀμύθητον ὅσον, θαυμαστά
ἡλίκα, ἀμήχανον zoor—phrases we meet
with in Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Asis-

tophanes, acc. 'l'he same expression occur!
in Tacitus and Sallust, and ⁴ mirum uan-
tum,’ ⁶ nimium qnantum,' are by
Cicero, and Livy (ii. l, firm). The oldest
Berne MS. has ⁴ discrepet, hut tho indi·
cative mood is right, ‘immane quantum'
being merely an expletive.

lo. Opuntiae] The birthplace of Me·
gilla (the Ina-ian Opus) is added, as Butt-
mann remarks, only '⁸ to give the poem a
stesher look of individuality.” The same
remark will apply in other instances, as, for
instance, ‘⁶ Xanthia Phocau” (C. ii. 4. 2).

19. laborabas] Several MSS. have ‘ la·
boras Charybdi· against the metre; one or
two have inserted the preposition ⁶ in' to
make the verse straightg but the oldest and
best MSS. have the imperfect tense, of which
Bentley can make nothing. Orelli may be
right in saying it refers tc the time when
the question was put. But 1 am not sure
that some finer sense of the imperfect tense
isnottcbetraced inthisword,asin
‘⁴ Tempus erat dapibus, sodales” (C. i. 37.
4, where see note).
