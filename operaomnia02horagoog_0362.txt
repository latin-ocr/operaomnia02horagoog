l. Ambubaiarum collegia] The reduc-
tion of Syria to the condition of a Roman
province (A.u.c. 689), while it opened to
the Romans the trade of the East, was the
means of introducing into Italy many evils
from the same quartem among others, the
class of women known by the above name,
of whom Acron aud Comm. Cruq. say that
they were so called in the Syrien lang-uage,
from an instrument of music they played
upon: “ etenim lingua eorum tibia sive
symphonia ambubaia dicitur.” These wo-
men, whose profession was that of prosti-
tutes, Horace speaks of jocularly as if they
had formed themselves into colleges or
clubs such aa at this time were very common
in Rome, some sanctioned by law, others
not. (See art. ‘ Collegium,’ in Smith's Dict.
Ant.) Juvenal refers to these women in
his third Satine (v. 62, sqq.)=

“Jam pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit
Et Qhrxi'gutgii, et mores, et cum tibicine
Οἱιῗίξῗὲειιοο non gentilia tympana secum

pkamacopolae,] These were itiner-ant
dealers in nostrums and vendere of medi-
cines, who were to be seen in the forum
and all places of public resort. They do
not appear to have got much custom.
M. Cato, in his speech against M. Caelius,
inveighs against him as an inveterate talker,
and says he was so greedy of speech that he
would hire people to listen to him3 and
that you rather heard than listened to the
man, like a ⁴ pharmacopola ’ who could make
his voice heard, but no siclt person ever
thought of putting himself into his hands.
(Gellius, N. A. i. 15). Cicero (pro Cluent.
14) makes mention of one L. Clodius, of
Anema, who practised this trade. Such

make music. They will stop at fit places,
make their music or their speech, give ad-

vice, hand out pills and other medicines,
receive their- money, and move on.

2. Meridie-id This word includes beggars
of all sorts, of whom a great variety ap-
peared as religione mendicante, priests for
instance of Isis or of Cybele (known by the
Greeks under the title of μητραγύρται) and
Jews, who made gain of their law, inventing
charms perhaps from it, and persuading the
foolish to purchase phylacteries. Juvenal
mentions this class of be iu his sixth
Satire (v. 643, sq.)= ⁴⁸ Arcenam Judaea
tremens mendicat in aurem Interpres legum
Solymarum.” There were also fortutm-
tellers in abundance all over the town. See
C. i. 11, Introd. Street musicians were as
common and as discordant at Rome as
among ourselves. of Jugglers likewise
there were swarms, and many other sorte of
impostura.

pantomimic parts were sustained also by
women. Horace mentions one of this class
named Arbuscula φ. i. 10. 76), who was a
celebrated ⁶ mima in cioem’s time (Ad
Att. iv. le, written A.u.c. 700)= “quaeris
nunc de Arbuscula. Valde placuit. Ludi
magnifici et grati.” As might be expected,
they were persons of loose character, as
the woman Origo mentioned below (v. 55),
and the before-mentioned Arbuscula, and
the woman Cytheris, whom M. Antonius
carried about with him under the name of
Volumnia (Cic. ad Att- x. 103 Phil. ii. 2⁴).

huldreum] The meaning and etymology
of this word are hopelessly lost. Cruquius'
Scholiast gives three different derivations3
from Servilius Balatro (mentioned S. ii.
Β. 21), who, as Forcellini observes, more
probably got his name from the speci s
than the species from himg ⁴ a balatu, from
an affected ridiculous way of speaking,
which is against prosody3 ‘a blatiendo,'
from their senseless babble3 and some he
says read ‘ barathrones,’as from ‘ barathrum,'
because they were gluttonous livers who de·
vom-ed their substance, according to Ho-
