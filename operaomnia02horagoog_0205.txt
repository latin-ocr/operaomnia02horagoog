180 HORATH FLAOGI

CARMEN XVI.

Horace here dwells on his savem-ite theme,—contentment end medentium—which he
is able to illustrate by the example of Maecenas ss well ss his own. The ingenuity which
has discovered the occasion thst gave rise to this ode will hardly throw any new light on
the meaning of it, which is very plain. whether therefore Horaoe’s friends had urged
him ιο mske more than he hed done of his opportunities with Maecenas for the purpose
of enriching himself or not msy very well remain doubtful. 1 confess the ides. would not
have occurred to me. The hench editors suppose it to be sn ode of thsnks to Maecenas
for the gift of the farm, which it certainly is not 3 ond one editor, J. F. Schmid, suspects
Horace meant gently to hint ιο his patron thet he should be glad of sn extension of his
liberality, a species of eipwysia which it is to be hoped does not represent the pn‘nciples
of the person who suggests'this notion. There is no clue to the dete of the ode further
then that it was written aster-Herses came into possession of his farm.

ARGUMENT.

A stout prison ond ssvnge watch-dogs might have kept Danae from barm but Jove end
Venus smiled‚ for they knew that the god need but change himself to gold, end the
wsy would be clear before him. Gold penetrates through gusrds3 gold shall burst
rocks3 thereby fell the house of Amphiaraum thereby the Macedonian won ciiien
thereby stern admirals are ensnsred. And ss it grows the desire for more grows too.
A high estote 1 dread. Maecenas, thou good knight, the more a man denies himself
the more the gods will give him. 1 fly from the rich to the' contented, and sm more
independent than any poor rich men in the world. My stream, end my little wood,
end my trusty field, sre s happier portion than all Africa. 1 hsve no honey of casa-
bris, nor wine of Formiae, nor Gnulieh fleece, yet poverty doth not pinch me; ond it 1

stricting of my muta, then if 1 had ull Lydis and Phrygis for my‘ own. who ask
