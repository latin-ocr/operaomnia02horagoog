CARMINUM ΙΙΙ. 4.

Texere, mirum quod foret omnibus,
Quicunque celsae nidum Acherontiae

Pingue* tenent humilis Forenti,
Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis
Dormirem et ursis, ut premerer sacra

Lauroque collataque myrto,

Non sine dis animosus infans.

the passage is undoubtedly corrupt (V. L. .
11* so, an attempta to mend it have only m e
it worse. Doves have their part in sundry
tales. Heyne's and Servius’ notes on Aen.
vi. 190 may be read by those who cere to
hear more about the birds of Venus.

9. Apulo—Apuliae] The difference in
the quantity of the first syllable is not sin-
gular. The word sicanus is used as three
different feet. Italus has the first syllable
long or short, and so with other names.

11. Ludo satiyatumque somno] It is
dear thet some other word like ⁸ oppres-
sum ’ must be understood for ⁸ somno. It
is a maslaum of καμάτῳ ‹idcina-dne ἠδὲ
καὶ ὕπνῳ ῼΙ. x. 98). Acherontis, Ban-
tia, and orentum were neighbouring
towns, and still retain their names under the
forms Acerenza, Vanzi, Forenza. Orelli,
with the authority of only one of his Reme
MSS. and that the latest, reads Forenti in-
stead of Ferenti, which Bentley has adopted.
The modern name is in favour of Forenti.
Orelli says the mistake arose from confound-
ing this place with Ferentinum, a Herni-
ean town. Stories such as Horace has here
invented for himself are told of Stesichorus,
Pindar, Aeschylus, Plato. That which
Pausanias (ix. 23) tells of Pleto is very like
this.

17. Ut—Dormt‘rem] This is connected
with ‘ mirum ς’ ⁴ how 1 slept! ·
ω22779ζτζΞξ-ον] Ovid uses the word (Met.

‘⁸ Collis apex medii subjectis imminet arvis ε
Tollor eo.''

⁸ Seu ' is understood aster ‘ vester! The
epithet ⁶ liquidae,' applied to Baiae, is ex-
plained by Cruquius' Scholiast of the clear-
ness and purity of the atmosphere.

28. Nec Sicula Palinurus unda] Horace's
ffiffizsszzffmiz ‘iffafflssifflffii
have been much perplexed es to the period
of his life to which it ought to be referred.
1 have no conjecture to offer. A suggestion
which has been pretty confidently put forth
(class. Mus. ii. 205), that Horace was
with the expedition against Sex. Pompeius,
nanc. 718, in which many vessels were lost
off Cape Palinurus, is inconsistent with the
silence Horace maintain- on the subject,
which in no where alluded to in any part of
his writings. It appears most improbable.
Francis, in his note on the first Epode,
makes the same statement: where he got it
1 do not know. Acron's commentis of no
velue: ‘⁶ Redeuntem ee Horatius de Mace-
donia periclitatum dicit.” ⁶ Sicula unda '
