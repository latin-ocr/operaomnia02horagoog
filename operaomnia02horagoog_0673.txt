Vulgavi fidicen ; juvat immemorata ferentem
ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.

Scire velis mea cur ingratus opuscula lector

Laudet ametque domi, premat extra limen iniquus!
Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor

Impensis coenarum et tritae munere vestis;

N on ego nobilium scriptorum auditor et ultor

Grammaticas ambire tribus et pulpita dignor:
“ Spissis indigna theatris

Hinc illae lacrimae.

and 3. 23: ‘⁴ Romanae fidicen lyrae.”
*011ζῖοῷἭί refers to Alenus, comparing

‘⁴ Ειίἑιοορε Aeogiiimfjermen ad Italos
e uxisse m os.

It may refer to Archilochus. I do not
feel certain about it. Forcellini only men-
tions one other example of ⁸ immemoratus ’
from Ausonius. ⁶ Ingenuis' Orelli thinks
is opposed to ‘libertinis,’ of which class
Horace's chief deu-actore, the grammarians,
were. (See below, v. 4⁰, n.) But Horace
may have had many friends who, like his
father, were not ‘ingenui ’ in this sense.
(See S. i. 6. 6, n.) Ι think he means
candid or uncorrupoed.

3⁶. inqratus] 1 suppose he means that
the render is ungi-ateful who geta gratifica-
tion from his poema at home, and yet
abuses them abroad3 so that ‘ingratus ' in
fact belongs ιο t-he second clause as well ss
‘iniquum' The reason Horace gives is,
that he does not go about secking the good
opinion of vulgar critics, giving them dinners
and cast-off clothes, and so on, but keeps

himself to the company of respectable

authors, listening ιο their writings and
getting them ιο listen to his own. The
language is taken from the notion of ean-
vassing for votes at an election.

38. Impemiae evenat-um] Persius has
imitated this (S. i. 54)-

Calidum scis ponere sumen.
Scis comitem horridulum trita donare la-
cerna.”

 

39. auditor et ultor] These words are
reciprocal.'1'he man who listens to a prosy
recitation has his revenge when he recites
in return. Here it is meant in a good-
humoured way. J uvenal s first Satire be-
ςίιιιι4 ‘Semper ego auditor tantum. > nun-
quamne reponam. >” As ιο the practice of

40

recitation among friends and in public, see
C. ii. 1, Int„ and S. i. 4. 73, n.

40. Grammaticus ambire tribus] noae
who made a profession of literature were
called ⁴ literati,’ ‘ eruditi,’ or ⁸ grammatici-⁹
Tho last name was applied principally to
those who kept- schools or gave lectura, of
whom there were a great many at this time
at Rome. Inferior writers would give a
good deal for their favourable opinion,
which would help their books into demand
among their scholare. Suetonius has given
a short notice of the principal machus, uf
whom he says the firstwas Grates of Mallos
(a city of Cilicia), who was sent on an em-
bassy to the senate by Attalus, king of
Pergamum, between the second and third
Punic wars- He broke his leg, and during
the continement this accident caused he
gave lectura, ἀκροάσεις, which exampb
was followed by others. At first, Suetonius
says, they took the works of deoeased
writers and commented upon these. Aster-
wards they came to wrifing themselves and
descanting upon their own works, then
upon those of their contemporaries. The
ffisssssskfflfflssa -ἶῗ ,Ἐὲἓηῖ
(that is, literature either Greek or Roman,
ancient or modern) was taught, as opposed
to the toachers of rhetoric, music. &a But
there were others whose lecturos were at-
tended by youths who had lest school and by
grown up persons. Some of them, Sueto-

excep tions fieedmen. (See above. r. 32. ιι.)
Horaee calls them ‘critici’ elsewhere (A. P.
78). ‘Pulp itum’ meant any raised plat-
form from which speeches were delivered.
Here it applies ιο that from which the
teachers delivered their lectures.

41. Hine illae lacrimae] This became
a conventional way of speaking aster Te
rence (Andr. i. l. 99). “Atat hoc illud est.
Hinc illae lam-imae, haec illa est miseri·
