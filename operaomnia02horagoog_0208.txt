Nec si plura velim tu dare deneges·

that it ιε so. ’The construction ιε like* ‘sensit

‘laestrygonia amphora (used like‘ Sabina
diota,⁹ which was the same sort of vessel,
C. i. 9. 7),⁴ an amphora of Formiau wine!
The inhabitants of Formiae supposed it ιο
be the same as the gonia mentioned
by Homer (Odyss. x. 81), -

The Scholiast on Lycophrou (Cassandra, v.
956) says, Λαιστρύγονες οἱ νῦν Λεοντῖνοι,
and Acron ιιι his noteraises a doubt whether
‘Laestrygonia amphora⁹ is ‘Formiana an
Sicula& but Pliny (N. H. iii. 5) writes,
“Oppidum Formiae, Hormiae dictum, ut
existimavere antiqua Laestrygonum urbs-⁹⁹
And Cicero, writing to Atticus (ii. 13), says,
“Si vero in hanc τηλίπυλον veneris Λαι-
στρυγονίην qui fiemitus hominum! quam

is said to have been
called b that name of oid. The Mygdonia
ofAsia ' or (part of Macedonia was also
so mued) was not very clearly defined, as
Strabo says (1.12). That Horace identifles
it with Phrygia appears from 0. ii. 12.
22, “Aut pinguis Pbrygiae Mygdonias

of the ruins of Tmy as⁴ ‘Mygdonii cineres!

‘Alyattei' is the genitive of⁴ attens:
another form of⁴ Aly attes⁹ (king oiyLydia),
as Achilleus -ei of Achilles, Ulyx eus -eioi'
Uly xes. Bentley has the merit of esta-
blishing this reading, to which Tan. Faber
made an approximation ιιι ‘Alyattii,⁹ seeing
that⁴ Halyatticiss the reading of all former
editions, had no meaning, though the edi-
tors supposed it to mean Croesus, the son
of Alyattes. 1 do not find from the editors
that there is any various reading⁴ Alyattei:
but that is now generally adopted.
