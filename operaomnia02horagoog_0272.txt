10. Gur-ritant martae pueris puellae ,·]
As Orelli says, ‘ puellae' ismost rarely used
for female slaves. The word in uae was
⁶ meinae' ‘Vertice' is the top of the fleme
which ⁴ flickers as it whirla the darlt amoke
on its creat? a spiral flame, terminatius in
a column of smoke. It seems-as if Horace
were writing with a fire buming before him,
and caught the idea as he wrote. Bentley
dislikes ⁸ trepidant,’ and proposes ‘ crepi-
tant,' which destroys the nnity of the image
altogether: moreover there is no respectable
authority for the change. Some com-
mentator-s make ⁴ vertico’ the roos of the
house.

15. man-inae] C. i. 3. 1. Venus was
said to have risen from the sea in the mouth
os April, which was therefore her mouth,
the name of which Macrobius derives from
ἅφροςι Varro more probably from ‘ape-
rio,' as the month that opens the year.
See C. i. 4, Introduction. The word ‘idus '
is derived from ⁶ iduare,’ which significa to
divide, and this explains ⁸ 11ηῶιῖ Baxter'a
dmivation from εἶδος, “ qnod plenam Lunae
faciem significare videtur, ” is nonsense,
wherever he got it from.

19. adfluentes ordinatumve] ‘Reckons
each year as it succeeds! “ Ordinatur
quicqni13 numero et successione constat ”

Age jam, meorum

21. Telephus is a favourite name with
Horace. For what reason this is the name
he chooses for youths whom maidens vainly
love, does not appear 3 but such is the fact.
⁴ gccupavit ' )signifies ⁴ has pre-occupied '

. ii. 12. 28 .
< 22. Non tuae tortis] This belongs to
‘ juvenem,' not to ⁶ puella! “ si qua voles
apte nubere nube pari ” (Ovid, Heroid. ix.
32). The ntories of Phaethon and Bellero-
phon, with which Horace detera this young
girl from aspiring to too high a connexion,
will be found in the Dice. Biog.

23. qrata compede] This is repeated
from C. i. 33. 14.

32. Finis] See Introduction, and com-
pare Propert. i. 12. 19 :—

⁸⁴ Mi neque amare aliam neque ab hac
discedere fas θείη

Cynthia prima fuit, Cynthia finis erit.”
Dacier infers from these words of Horace
that he meant henceforth to transfer his
affectione to boys. Str-ange are the ideas
that commentatore extract from the sim-
plest language of this author. why ia not
the same nonsense drawn from the above
words of Propertius? 1 see no differ-enee
in the spirit of them. whether ⁶ condisce
modos' means ‘ practice some of your songs
before you come,’ or, ‘come and leam a song
