Silence the horn and drum, whose followera are vain glory and broken faith-

N mmm, Vare‚ sacra vite prius severis arborem

Circa mite solum Tiburis et moenia Catili.

Siccis omnia nam dura deus proposuit, neque

Mordaces aliter diffugiunt sollicitudines,

Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat? 5
Quis non te potine, Bacche pater, teque, decens Venus?
At ne quis modici transiliat mussera Liberi

Centaurea monet cum Lapithis rixa super mero
Debellata‚ monet Sithoniis non levis Euius,

Cum fas atqup nefas exiguo fine libidinum

Discernunt avidi.

Invitum quatiam, nec variis obsita frondibus
Sub divum rapiam. Saeva tene cum Berecyntio

Et tollens vacuum plus nimio Gloria verticem,

Arcanique Fides prodiga, perlucidior vitro,

penultimate syllable of Catillus’ name for

gives the best sense. The story ia that at the

Lapithae, the Centaure, being guests, at-

where Servius in his commentary quotes
this passage of Horace. The whole passage
is Greek in ita character. The Liberalia
bore little analogy to the Dionysia to which
the thyrsus and the cista with its sam-ed
contenta (whatever they may have been)
and its covering of vine and ivy belonged.
The picture of vain glory holding high its
head, fuu only of the fumes οἰ debauch,
is very happy whether original or not.
The other characteristic of the maudlin
state is gepeated once or twice. See Epod.
