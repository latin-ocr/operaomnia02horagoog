CARMEN XVII.
A.U.C. 728 (ἒ).

The two laet linea of thia ode, showing that Horace had not yet paid the sacrifice he
had vowed to Faunus for hia preservation from death, makes it most probable that it was
written not long aster C. 13 of thia book, the compodtion of which hm been assigned with
aome hesitation to Arm-c. 728. In the same year Maecena· appears to have recovered
from a bad attack of sever to which he waa liable, and was received with appianae in the
theatro on hia first appearance aster hia illnesa (C. i. 20. 3). But his recovery seem
to have been only partial3 and it would appear that Horace had to listen to hiscomplaints
and apprehensione of death, hia fear of which ia said to have been great.

ARGUMENT.

Why kill me with thy complaints? Ι cannot survive thee, Maecenas: one half of my life
being gone, how should the other stay behind? 1 have aworn to die with thee, and the
monster-a of Hell shall not separate us. Our star ia one and the same. The power of
Jove rescued thee from the adverae influence of Satura on that day when thou wert
received with acclamations in the theatin, and Faunus at the same time reecued me
from death. Offer thy sacrifice and dedicate thy temple, and Ι will offer my unpre·
tending lamb.

Oua me querelis exanimas tuis!
Nee dis amicum est nec mihi te prius
Obire, Maecenas, mearum
Grande decus columenque rerum.
Ah te meae si partem animae rapit 5
Maturior vie, quid moror altera,
Nec carus aeque nec superstes
Integer? Ille dies utramque
