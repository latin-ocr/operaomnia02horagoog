SATIRE X.

The line of sels-defenoe Horace took in the fourth Saum (see Introduction, and v. 6, ιι),
led him into ο, (triticiam of Lucilius, which gave e fresh handle ιο his adversaries, who pro-
remed an admiration for that poet, but admired him for his ποι-ει fnulte of teste, unii
especially for hin combination of Greek words with his mother tongue,—⁸ practice thr*
affectation of which no one would more instinctively feel und condemn than Horace, ‘'i'he
occasion did not give scope for much good writing, und the antire han little merit as ο, com-
position. Somebody wishing ιο try his ekill in imitating Horace, preflxnd to this poem
the following vernes, which are generally, though not universnlly, allowed ιο be spurious,
hut which appetu· in the oldest existing MSS. anke (F. H. p. 107) says they ure
genuine. They ate discussed in un Excursus by Orelli, und in n popei· by Jacobs (Lect.
Ven. xi.) :—

⁸⁸ Lucili, quam sis mendosus, teste Catone
Defensore tuo, pervincum, qui male factos
Emendare pent vei-sung hoc lenius ille
Est quo vir melior, longe subtilior illo,
Qui multum puer et loris et funibus udis

ARGUMENT.

wall, 1 mid that Lucilius' ymen were rough. And who cun deny it? But 1 gave him
meditutthe sume time for hisgreet wit. 1f allowing this 1 am toallowhimevery
thing, the farcen of Laberius 1 must eall poema of great beauty. It is not enough ιο
nise ο, laugh, though that hae ite meritg there should be tei-senem and variety, going from
greve to gay, from the severe antor or the keen marist ιο the poliahed wit. A mixture
os humour and severity is the way ιο settle grave questions. This wne the ground of the
old comediam, whom Hermogenes and his mincing tribe never read ο, word of.

‘⁴ Oh l but Lucilius wne great in the blending of Greek words with our own.'’ Block·
heudo! Is that ι great thing which Pitholeon cun do? ‘⁴ But ο, lnngmge eompounded
os the two is surely eo much evector, like mixing Chim and Falci-niun wines.” Now 1
ask you, would you epply that rule ιο the langunge of the Forum? md while our great
advocates ure working out their speechea with much labour in the beet possible hfin,
would you mix up yours with Greek? When 1 once thought of writing Greek verses
the shnde of Romulus appeared ιο me by night, und bede me rather carry fnggota to the
foi-eet. So while Alpinus is munies-ing heroes in bombast, 1 stick ιο my unambitioua
trifles. Fundanius my mite comedy, ns he does better than any mun living3 Pollio
