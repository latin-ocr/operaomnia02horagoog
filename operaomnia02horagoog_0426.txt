94. A certis annis] ‘ From any given
period.' He means that at all times from
his 111-84118 upwards, his father had been 10
him all that a father could be. 4 Legere ad
fastum,' to choose with reference 1ο 8111-
bition whatever parents each man might
desire. Most of the editions are so pointed
as to make 4 quoscunque ’ independent of
⁴ optaret,’ and the sense to be ‘ optaret sibi
quisque,’ each man might cboose for him-
self, or each man would choose, as Lambinus
says. But ‘opto' will hardly bear this
sense here, and the position 01· 4 quoscun-
que ' makes the other the more natural
construction. 80 Acron takes it: ‘⁸ Si
fieret illi potestas eligendi a fatis quos vellet
parentes contentus essem parentibus meis.'’
We know nothing of Horace's mother,
whom he probably lost in very early lif03
but he here intimates 1118 respect for her
memor-y as well as his father's.

96. honestos] Several MSS. have ‘ho-
nustos’ and 4 0111181083 and Lambinus says
that reading has older and better authority
than ‘ honestos) The Blandinian MSS. and
all Cruquius' others had 4 honestos) Tor-
rentius denies Lambinus' assertion, which
Rutgersius defends. (Lect. Ven. c. 17.)
But ⁶ onustos ' in 811 probability arose out
of v. 99. Τ118 Scholiasoe had ⁶ honestos.’
On the ‘fasces ' and ⁴ sella curulis,' their
nature, and the officers entitled to use
them, all information may be obtained from
Smith’s Dict. Ant.

98. sortasse] The Greeks used ἴσως 111
this way where 8 certain and not a doubtful
proposition is intended.

101. salutandi plurem] This does not
mean that he would have more acquaint-
ances, 11111 11181 111 order to preserve his
position 118 1111181 8811 1118 independence,
bowing to persons he would not otherwise
notice, and paying visits of ceremony early

in the morning, —- a trouble that Horace
would secl more than most men. Other
interpretations have-been given, 11111 11118 18
obviously Horace's meaning. He must
also, he says, hire one or two persons to go
about with him in the character of clients3
118 1111181 buy a number of horses and slaves
of the lower sort. 4 Calones ’ were properly
slaves who went with the army, carrying
the heavier part of the soldiers' accoutre-
ments. But the word was also applied to
domestic slaves employed on menial work.
The 4 petorritum ' was a four-wheeled car-
riage. Gellius, who has a chapter on the
subject (xv. 30), affirms, on the authority of
Varro, that it was introduced from Gaul
beyond the Alps. Festus says 8 1181118 18
derived from the number of its eels, and
the Welsh ⁴ pedwar,' ‘ four,’ and ‘riden,'
⁸ wheels,' make the Celtic origin of the name
not improbable. (See Gronovius' note on
the above passage of Gellius.) The Aeolio
form πίτυρες, 81111 1118 080811 ‘petur,'
4 four,’ and the Latin ‘ rota,' show that the
above is not the only etymology of which
‘ petorritum ' is capable. Comm. Cruq. on
Epp. ii. 1. 192, says the ⁶ petorritum' was
used for the conveyance of semele slaves3
11111 there is no reason to suppose it was
limited 1ο that use.

104. curto Ire licet mulo] This Porcel-
lini interprete, after Comm. Cruq., 4 1108118113
Orelli says this is only an English practice,
aud supposes it 1ο have been unknown to
the Romans. But whoever Cruquius’ mys-
terious Scholiast may have been, he was
not 811 Englishman, nor of very medem
times. He must have seen 4 docked ⁷ horses,
for no man would imagine them that had
not. The interpretation 4 castrato,' which
Orelli attributes to Forcell.‚ does not appear
in the English edition of his Lexicon.
