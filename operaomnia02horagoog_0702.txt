flourished uring the latter half of the fourth
century mc. at the court of Philip, and in
the camp of Alexander. This story—that
Alexander would not suffer himself to be
painted by any but Apelles—is referred to
by Cicero in his letter to Lucceius (ad Fam.
v. 12)= ‘⁸ Neque enim Alexander ille gra-
tiae causa ab Apelle potissimum pingi et a
Lysippo fingi volebat3 sed quod illorum
artem eum ipsis tum etiam sibi gloriae fore
putabat.” See also Pliny (vii. 38) and
Plutarch (Alex. ct 4). His merite are de-
soeibed in the wal-mest tems by Pliny, aud
painter stood higher than
any other os antiquity. His most cele·
brated painting was that of Aphrodite
rising froin the sea, which existed in the
time of Augustus, and was placed by him
in the temple of Julius Caesar.

Lysippus was a younger contemporary of
Apelles, and anat-ive of Sicyon. He wrought
almost entirely in bronze, and was the
author of the statue from which the Farnese
Hercules was copied by Glycon. · He made
several statues of Alexander, whom he ap·
pears like Apelles to have followed into
Asia. Plutarch (de Fort. et Virt. Alex. ii.
2) says ἦν δὲ καὶ Ἀπελλῆς ὁ ζωγράφος
καὶ Λύσιππος ὁ πλάστης κατ’ Ἀλέξων·
spev- ὧν ὁ μὲν ἔγραψε τὸν κεραυνόφορον
οὕτως ἕνα γῶς καὶ κεκραμένως ὥστε
λέγειν, ὅτι υοῗν Ἀλεξάνδρων ὁ μὲν Φι-
λίππου γέγονεν ἀνίκητος ὁ δὲ Ἀπελλοῦ
ἀμίμητος. And of Lysippus he says:
Λυσίππου δὲ τὸν πρῶτον Ἀλέξανδρον
πλάσαντος ἅνω βλέποντα τῷ προσώπῳ
πρὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν (ὥσπερ αὐτὸς εἰώθει
βλέπειν Ἀλέξανδ ος ἡσυχῆ πορε κλίνων
ἑὸν τράχηλον) πέγραψέ τις ο s ἀπι-

λεύσσων·

his reputation as a

γᾶν ὖπῚ el τίθεμαι, Ζεῦ, σὺ ‹woma-
πον χε.

And he goes on to say that Alexander
ordered that Lysippus alone should make
his statues, because he was the only artist
who represented his character, and while
adhering to his features did not fail to bring
out his virtues. The rest imitated his
peculim· bend os the neck, and τῶν ὀμμά-
των τὴν διάχυσιν καὶ ὑγρότητα (which
means 1 suppose au extraordinary bright-
ness and rapid glaucing of the eyes). but
did not resent his manly and lion-like
aspect (rx ἀρῤενωπὸν καὶ λεοντῶδες), in
which therefore Lysippus may be supposed
to have been successful.

244. Boeotum ιἰι craeso] Respecting
the proverbial dulness and sensuality of the
Boeotians, which Polybius said was un—
paralleled in Grecian history, see Thirlwall
(Hist. Greece, i. 13), who attributes it, not
to ‘⁴ the dampnees and thickness of their
atmosphere,'' but to ‘⁴ the profusion with
which the ordinary gista of nature were
spread over the face of Boeotia, the abun-
dant returns of its grain, the richnees of its
