Euroms atque Cratinus Aristophanesque poetae,

Atque alii quorum comoedia prisca virorum est,

Si quis erat dignus describi quod malus sc fur,

Quod moechus foret aut sicarius aut alioqui

Fumosae, multa cum libertate notabant. 5

1. Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristophanes·
que] These three represent the Old Comedy,
of which they were the scknowlodged
leaders. See Quintilian (x. 1)· “Plures
ffffcfitzmffffiass ‘·⁸”¹.⁰.31⁰‘1›{‡¹J1'3;
(ιδ. i. 123)=—

The vigour sud boldness of Cratinus'
writings is described by Aristophanes
(Knights, 526, sqq„ sud elsewhere), who
wss sbout seventy years his Junior, though
they were rivale the year before Cratinus’
death, ιι. c. 453, when he won the first
prise, end Aristophanes the third with the
Clouds. The satire of Eupolis was also
very unspsring, ss we lesrn ss well from
other notices ss from the story (true or
false) thet Alcibiades hsd him thrown over-
bom-d nt ses for lampo’oning him. The
other writers of the Old Comedy, whom
Horace alludes to with respect, ure very
little known to us. Their names, with those
of the writers of the Middle sud New
Comedy, may be found in Clinton (F. H.
v. ii. pp. 36-47), sud s few ere noticed m
Donnldson's Greek Theatre (pp. 106—114).
Τίιο distinction was invented by the Alex-
andrine grammatias. The old ended with
Aristophanes. The middle was supported
chiefly by Eubulus, Anti phanes, Anmndri·
des, sud Alexis, end hsted over sbout fifty
' years of the fourth century mc. of the
New Comedy, which the Romans imi-
tated, the principsl writers were Philemon,
Menander, Diphilus (see Pml. Adelphi),
sud Posidippus, who wss the lest os the

Greek comio poete, end died about mc.

denies tho existence of s Middle Comedy,
with which question we ere not conoerned
here, but need only observo thet Horace
fixes on the Comoedia. Prisce, because the
subsequent pheses of the Greek Comic
Drsms were not of the seme personslly
satiricsl cest, the license granted to the
old writers having been taken away by lsw.
The new comedy was like our own, using
the lsngunge of deily life to show in sn

of humen nature· while the old desit in
invectives sguinst socisl, politicel, or in·
dividusl vices dressed up in grotesque lan·
gunge end imsges. It is to the lsngmge
of the New Comedy that Horace refers in
this satire, when he puts the question
whether s comedy is or is not s
Between his own writings end the Old
Comedy there' ιο little or no anslogy. The
words ‘poetae’ sud ‘virorum’ ure used
emphaticully, as below in S. 10. 16. “Illi
scripte quibus comoedis prisce viris est.”

5. multa cum libertate notabant] Cicero
(de Repub.iv.10) says that to the Greeks

“suit etism lege concessum ut quod vellet
comoedis de quo vellet nominatim diceretss'
All he could mean was, thet during the
period of the Old Comedy‚ the lsw did not
interfere with this liberty, except upon two
occasions (only one of which occurred during
the time Aristophanes was writa'ng), when
psephisms were passed prohibitiug the in·
troduction upon the stage of living charac-
ters ss objects of satire by neme,—s restric-
tion os no great force, since the substitution
of s. feigned nume, slightly altered from the
