EPISTOLARUM Ι. 17.

Sed tacitus pasci si posset corvus haberet

Plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque.
Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum,
Qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbres,
Aut cistam effractam et subducta viatica plorat,

Nota refert meretricis acumina, saepe catellam,

⁵⁵

Saepe periscelidem raptam sibi flentis, uti mox
Nulla fides damnis verisque doloribus adsit.
Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curat

Fracto crure planum, licet ini plurima manet

Lacrima, per sanctum juratus dicat Osirim:

“ Credite non ludo; crudeleS, tollite claudum.''
‘⁴ Quaere peregrinum,” vicinia rauca reclamat.

60. Sed tacitns pasci ] Erasmus says
this is taken from a fable referred to by
Apuleius in his book respecting the δαίμων
&Soanta-‚inwhoeha fox cheats a crow
out of something good. How Horaee’s
crow is connected with that does not ap-
pear. A crow open-mouthed is his illus-
tration of a greedy sellom ss “corvum de-
ludet hiantem ” (S. ii. 5. 56), and it means
this here. If Horace had any fable in
view, its purport and application are suf-
ficiently plain. A crow cawing over the
morsel luck or thieving has thrown in
his way, and thereby attracting the atten-
. tion and envy of his brethren, applies to
many a knave who loses his ill-gotten gains
through his own folly in parading them.

52. Brundisium comes cat Surrentum]
To Brundisium a man might go on busi-
ness 3 to Surrentum (Sorrento) for the climate
and scenery, which are still very healthy and
beautiful. Surrentum was made a Roman
colony about this time. We do not hear
much of it as a pbce of recol-t, though from
this passage we may infer that it was one of
the pleasant spots on the Campanian coest
to which the wealthy Romans went for
change of air. Its wines were celebrated
(see Epp- 15. 16, n.). In mentioning

Brundisium, Horace may have been think-
ing of his journey with Maecenas.

54. viatica] See Epp. ii. 2. 26, n.

55. catellam] This is a diminutive form
of ‘catenass and is used for a bracelet or
necklace: ‘periscelis’ appears to be an
annet, such as women and young children
of both sexes in the East wear nniversally.
But other meanings have been given (see
Dict. Ant.). ⁴ Nota acumina' means ⁴ the
hackneyed tricks!

59. stacte crure planum] The Romans
adopted the Greek word πλάνος for a
vagabond and impostor (see Porcell. ).
Aaou says it was the name of an impostor
wheresortedtothis trick in ordertogeta
ride. As to ‘plurima,’ see C. i. 7. 8, n.
Horace makes the man swear by the Egyp-
tian Osiris, as if that were the most sacred
of oaths. Among other new superstitione
the worship of Isis had been lately intro-
duced into Rome. Efforts were made from
time to time to put it down, and Augustus
forbade its being exercised in the city. But
under later emperors it became established
with the encouragement of the government,
in conjunction with that of Serapis. Osiris
was not worshipped separately, but shared
