‘38 HORATII FLAOGI

the aspect of public affairs drew forth this ode. The Scholiasta ue at var-ianoe. Porphy-
rion, whom Lambinus follows, supposes Horace is addressing himself to the feara of
Brutus, and dissusding him from renewing the battle at Philippi, aster the death of
Cassius—a strange time for writing verses aster the manner of Alcaeus, and au unusual
way for a military tribune to offer counsel to his commender-in-chief. Acron supposes
Horace to be alluding to the designs of the republican party, under Sextus Pompeius.
This opinion is supported at some length by Buttmann, Mythol. i. 343, sq., who argues
that the ship does not signify the commonwealth, for that Horace speaks as if he were
separated from the subject of the allegoryz that to advise the citizens to abstain from
civil wars (represented by the sea) because they-‘were in a crippled condition, would be ω
imply that they might engage in them if they were not in that condition ς also that there
would be no propriety in representing the state as a dismasted ship in the time of Augus·
tus. I-Ie therefore considers that all this refers ιο the efforts of the broken but restlees party
to which Horace had been lately attached to repair their fortunes under the leading of Sext.
Pompey. ‘ Nudum remigio latus,' he says, refers to the number of theirbeet men cut
off at and since Philippi (he might have added the deser-tion of Menas). The ‘ desiderium,'
spoken of in v. 18 menna the linger-ing affection and anxiety Horace had for the party he
had first east in his fortune· vitu, and ⁶ medium’ the vention he had mfferfflmommon
with Brutus and all his best officers at the state of the republican forces at Philippi.
⁴ Pontica pinus,' he considers a very mesterly allusion to Pompey the Great, us the con-
queror of Mithridates, which is Acron’s opinion. 1 give this theory in deference ιο the
author, who has few equals in critical sag-acity‚ and who in the essay in which these views
are put forwurd has done good service to the interpretation of Horace on the principles
of common sense. 1 should mention however that the theory has but few supporters, of
whom Gesner certainly is one, and his was no mean judgment. Passow is another.
Franks cannot sufficiently express his astonishment at Buttmann’s strange doctrine.
Having made up his mind that none of the odes in these three books were written before
Actium, A.U.c. 723, he adopts the opinion of Torrentius, Messon, Sanadon, and others,
that Horace wrote this ode at the time when Augustus waa thinking of retiring from the
head of affairs (A.u.c. 725), and when he was dissuaded by Maecenas in a speech in which
he likened the state ιο a vessel tost upon the waters without a pilot (Dion Cass. 52. 16).
It does not seem to have occurred ιο Franke, that apposing the histor-ian to bave related
the actual words of Maecenas, which is somewhat improbable, it is as likely he got his
image from Horace as Horace from him. But the image was common enough and
always will be, and it is as phin as possible that Horace got his notion not from Maecenas
but from Alcaeus. Besides the cautious contained in this ode are plainly addressed not to
Augustus but to the citizens, and so far from requiring such cautious they were importu-
nate in requesting him ιο remain as he was.

Kirchner, who speaks of Buttmann's opinion as ‘ infelicissima,' has no hesitation in
referring the ode, with Epod. vii„ to the year before the battle of Actium, when the
flames of war were kindling again between Augustus and Antony. Jani, Mitsch„ Doering
are of the same opinion, and Dillenbr. rather prefers it. Orelli is silent.

Haviug now stated all the opinions that 1 hare seen upon this much-disputes! ode,
1 must leave the reader ιο judge for himself. That there was many an honr when
norme sighed for peace between the day he found himself established in his scribe's
office to that which brought Augustus home in triumph is certain, aud that he felt as a
nan of weak nerves might feel in a storm during the troubles of that long period may
well be supposed. 1 think it is very hard to say at what precise juncture in those stix-ring
times the notion entered his head of sitting down to write an ode in close imitation of
Alcaeus, though we may safely affirm, that the idea would only be natural while Rome was
disturbed, and therefore that the ode was written before the death of M. Antonius in sim-c.
724. of the theorias above given 1 prefer Acron's.
