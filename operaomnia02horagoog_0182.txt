42. eapitis minor] It is explained in
the article‘ caput 'inSmith's Dict- Ant„
that a Roman citizen taken prisoner by the
enemy lost his status or civil rights. Livy
says the Romans always wanted compa-saion
for their own soldiers taken ιιι war (xxii.

who from the earliest times shewed very
little indulgence for prisoners of war, they
were deterred by the magnitude of the
ransom asked for Hannibal’ s prisoners from
listening to their envoys. The vacillation
of the senate on that occasion resembles

their behaviour as Horace represents it in
the ease of Reginus.

The authenticity of the story of Regulus,
as far as concerns his interview with the
senate and his return, is not doubted. The
horrore of his death have been uestioned,
and among others by Niebuhr. ose who
wish to read what has been said upon the
subject will be referred to the authorities
by turning to the article Regulus in Smith’s
Diet. Bi .

GARMEN VI.
About A.U.c. 728.

As the former odes are addressed more to qualities of young men, this τείως more
especially to the vices of young women, and so Horace discharges the promise with which
this series of odes begins. The state of female morula at the time Horace wrote was
probably not so bad as it hemum shortly afterwards, though his picture is dark enough.

In v. 13 there is an allusion to the battle of Actium, which makes it evident that this
ode was written aster that event. There is no clue to the date but this, and we may fairly
assume that it was written about the same time as the others of this set.
