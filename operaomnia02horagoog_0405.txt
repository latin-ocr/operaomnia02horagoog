Cocceius Capitoque simul Fonteius, ad unguem
Factus hom0, Antoni non ut magis alter amicus,
Fundos Aufidio Lusco praetore libenter

32. Capitoque Not
much is known of C. Fonteius Cupito. He
was deputed by Angustus on this ocoesion,
ss being s particular friend of Μ. Antonius,
who afterwards, ss Plutarch relatas (Anton.
36) sent him, while he wss in Syrie, to fetch
Cleops trs thither from Egypt. When Au-
gustus isid down the consulship in Α. u ..c
721, Capito wss sppointed Consul Suffectus.
He hsd s ιοιι who wns consul with Ger-
manicus inme. 765, with whom Heindorf
confounds Antonius³ friend in the text.
Orelli mentions ι, coin of this Capito with
the following inscription =—“ c. rous-sive.
carn-0. rno- en. = ιι. Am. mr. σοι.

The expression ‘ sd unguem iectus ³ is taken
from the (ιι-ιη of the sculptor, who tries the
snrfsce of his statue by passing the nsil
over it· ir the parts be put perfectly to-
g'ether, sud the whole work well finished,
the neil pesses over the sui-fece, end meets
with no obstruction.“T1-enslstio sumpts

levitatem explorent” (Comm. Cruq..)
