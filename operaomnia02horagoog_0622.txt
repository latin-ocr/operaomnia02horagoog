EPISTLE X.

This Epistle is addressed to Fuscus Aristius, whose name appears in C. i. 223 S. i. 9.
613 lo. 83. For such particulare us mn be stated about him see the Introduction to the
above Ode. It appears that his habits inclined him to a town life. He was making
money in some way, und he was associated with all Hornce’s liter-ary and other friends,
Horace praises the freedom, the natural beandos, und the heulthiness of the country, und
shows thet they are natural to men’s tsstoe from the attempts they make to get trees in
their town houses and s prospect over the flelds. He follows this up with s few miscella-
neous remarks on the pursuit of wealth, how it blinds the εγω to the distinction between
truth and falsehood, und how prosperity only makes edversity more hard to beer and dis-
appointment more bitter, und subjectu the mind to a gulliug ulmei-y..

There· ιο no clue to the date.
