438 HORATII FLAOGI

ARGUMENT.

Some men think my satire too severe, others think it wsnts power. Tell me, Trebatius,
what sm Ι to do?

Keep quiet.

What, not write et su?

Thst is my advice.

Well certainly it would be better-3 but 1 cen get no rest. ‘

Then go end swim the Tiber, or drink freely over nightg or, if you must write, write of
Csessr’s renowm and you will get your reward.

Good father, Ι have no strength for thst: the battle-field is not s fit theme for every one.

But you may write of his virtues sud his fortitude, as Lucilius wrote of Scipio's.

So 1 will when opportunity offers. But Caesar is only to be sppmsched et the proper
time. Stroke him clumsily end like s spirited horse he kicks. -

But how much better is this then to libel buffoons end prodigas, end so make sn enemy
of every body.

What sm 1 to do? Every men hes bis teste, eud mine is to sti-ing words together, es
Lucilius did. He tmsted all his secret thoughts to his books z in prosperity or edversity
he made them his friend„ so that there you see the men’s life dnwn out es in ι
picture. Him the humble poet of Venusia follows. But 1 stteck no one without pro-
vocationi why should 1? 1 desire pesce, but woe to the men thet rouses me. He’ll
suffer for it, und find himself the talk of the town. Andthis is in the course of nature.
Every animal defends itself with its own proper weapons. Tine long end short os it is
1 must write whether 1 am to die presently or in s quiet old age, rich or poor, st home
or en exile, whatever or when-ever 1 may be.

Young men, 1 fest your life is not worth much= your great friends will freeze you to
desth.

why. were Laelius sud Scipio offended with Lucilius when he sttscked sll the great men
of his day, spei-ing none but the virtuous? Ney, they loved him end lived with him
most familiai-ly. 1 may be much beneeth Lucilius in weelth end genium but 1 too
heve illustr-ioue friends, and if any one thinks to put his teeth into me he will find him·
self mistsken. Do you object to thet, Trebatius?

No, Ι do not. But Ι must remind you that if any men write scurribus venes against
another the lew ellows him s remedy.

1 grant you, scurrilons: but what if they ere good end proper verses, end the person
worthy to be exposed?

Why then the court will leugh st the joke, end you will come off scot free.
