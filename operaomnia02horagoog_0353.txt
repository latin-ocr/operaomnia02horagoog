HORATII FLAOGI

Perfidus hic caupo, mileS, nautaeque per omne

Audaces mare qui currunt, hac mente laborem

30

Sese ferre, senes ut in otia tuta recedant,

Aiunt, quum sibi sint congesta cibaria: sicut
Parvula, nam exemplo est, magni formica laboris
Ore trahit quodcunque potest atque addit acervo,

Quem struit haud ignara ac non incauta futuri.

35

Quae, simul inversum contristat Aquarius annum,
N on usquam prorepit et illis utitur ante

Quaesitis sapiens ς quum te neque fervidus aestus
Demoveat lucro, neque hiems, ignis, mare, ferrum,

Nil obstet tibi dum ne sit te ditior alter.

Quid juvat immensum te argenti pondus et auri ,

Horace does not -mean that to be the only
solution of the universal discontent. That
would be absurd, and one at least of his
own exemplos would contradict his theory,
the jurisconsultus, who did not pursue his
laborious vocation for pay. He therefore
shifts or limite his ground a little, and
dwells upon that which he supposes to be
the most prevalent cause of discontent;
and with his ground he changes his ex-
amples. There is no reason, therefore, to
suspect the reading ‘ perfidus hic caupo, ’
which has caused the critice a vast deal of
trouble ever since Markland first suggested
that it was wrong. Before that, the com-
mentators were all satisfied to take Horace
as they found him. Orelli has given nine
different conjectural readings, not one of
which seems to me to have any merit. Fea
has found in a few MSS. the word 4 campo ⁹
for 4 caupo,' but that is not surprising.
There are no other vuiations in the MSS.
or Scholiasta, and this gives no sense at all.
‘Nauta' and‘ mercator' here are the same
n, the trader navigating his own ship.
SeeC. i. 28. 23, and Ιιι.ιι·). ‘Perfidus
caupo' appears again in ‘cauponibus atque
malignis¹ (S. i. 5. 4). 4Ροι· omne Audaces
mare qui currunt’ is repeated from C.i
⁹ sqq·

32. cibaria.- ·] This word, which‘ is gene-
rally used for the rations of soldiers or slaves,
is used here ironically for the humblest
provision that can be made sor the latter
years of life, as if that was all that these
men set before their minds.

35. haud iynara ac non incauta-fictura]
Experience tells her that fimes will change,
and instinct teaches her to provide against
that change; she knows what is coming,

and providos accordingly. This ia what

Horace meansg but the ant is torpid in the
winter, and lays up no store in her house for
that sesson, though no error is more com-
mon than to suppose she does. These
animala work hard during thewarmer months
of the year, but the food they gather is con-
sumed before the winter. ‘Quae ¹ is op·
posed to‘ quum te? ‘now she.'‘1nversum
annum' is eompounded of the two notione
‘inversum caelum' and‘ mutatum annum!
The sun enters Aquarius in the middle of
January. Virgil uses the word‘ contristat '
(Georg. iii. 279). “unde nigerrimus Auster
Nascitur, et pluvio contristat frigore cse-
lum.” The MSS. are divided between
tggpsstemdiviiigd. Acron hedTPgatfflhzsntd
interpreted it‘ contenta) while Porphyrion’ s
reading, and that of Cruqmus commentator,
was ‘sapiens.’ The editions before Lam-
binus 1 believe, with scarcely any excep-
tions, have 4 patiens! He restored 4 sa-
piens,' which Cruquius found in all his
MSS. and 1 have no doubt it is the right
word. It suits the context, and corresponds
to >what Horace says elsewhere (C. iv. 9.

“Nec possidentem multa vocaveris
Recte beatum ς rectius occupat
Nomen beati, qui deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti—allow

The question at issue is not one of patience,
but of prudence in the pursuit and the use
of wealth, both of which, according to the
vulgar error, the ant is famous for. She is
one of the 44 four things which are little
upon the earth, but they are exceeding
wisc ''-—the ants, the couies, the locusta,
and the spiders. (Prov. xxx. 24, sqq.)-

39. equis, mare, serrum] This is a

patiens.
