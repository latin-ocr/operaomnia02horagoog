Q. HORATII FLAccl

CARMINUM·

LIBER TERTIUS.

 

CARMEN Ι.

About A. me. 728.

Tms end the five following odes are generally edmitted to be among the finest speci-
mens of Horaee’s manner, sud it appears to me that in this diductio style he shows most of
his own character snd genius. It is, ns sm· as we know, entirely his own. There is no opi-
nion from which 1 more entirely dissent than this of Franks, ‘⁶ Toto. Horatii poesis lyrim
et ex ipsius sententis diei et haberi potest amatoria” (F. H. p. 57). And Buthnmn’s
sentence, which goes into the other exn-eme, appears to me as far from the trath, unless
he limita it, aa 1 bouem he many meant ω do, ω tho style that kao'thinkn his atu-ongean
“ Non-reolity,’' he says, ‘⁶ is an essentinl feature of Honee's odes.” The fuet appears to
be, that reality was so much a part of Horaoe’s mind, that he wne never so great ss when
he wrote on some real subject, something that drew out his sound eommon sense, his
regu-d for s friend, his sense of right, his appreciation of nature, and his feeling-s ‘in
respect to the times he lived in md especially the condition of Rome itself. It is this
that gives to the six odes with which the third book opens the soree and chum we find in
them. It has been already said (C. ii. 15, Introduction) that they appear all to have
been written about the same time with one' another und wit-h other odes, namely. that
time when Augustus set himself the tnsk of soeisl reformetion aster the elose of the civil
wars-

'l'he general pur-port of this ode is an exhortstion to moderate living end desii-es.

The first stanna. is generally understood to have been added ns sn introductioni to the

six odes, viewed as a whole.
ARGUMENT.

The worldly 1 despise, but have neve precepta for the young.

Kings mle over their people, but ere themselves the subjecte of Jove. One may be
richer, another nobler than his follows, but all anko must die. No indulgence esu get
sleep for him who hus a swerd ever henging over him, while it disdsins not the dweninga
of the poor. He who is content with a little fem-s not storm or drought. The rich
man builds him heusen on the very wetere, but anxiety follows him go where he viu.
11· then marble and purple, rich wines and eostly pei-fumes, eure not grief, why should
1 build me great houses, or exchange for the burthen of riches my humble Sabine
