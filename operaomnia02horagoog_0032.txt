The prodigies desa-ibet! st the beginning of this ode ere those which were said to heve
followed tho «leeth of Julius Csem. They ure related also by Vir-gil, Georg. i. 466—489,
which passage, end the verses that follow it to the end of the book, should be reed in oon-
nexion with this ode. It will uppem· to any render of both very probable thet Horeoe hed
this desmipfion in his mind when he wrote. It hes been thought thet Horace could not heve
referred to prodigies which had occurred so long before (mmo. 71⁰, fifteen years before
this odo was written), when he was et Athens, end therefore could not heve witnessed
them. Other prodigies therefore heve been mumed ns the mbjeet of these opening

late for this ode, in which the allusione to the stete of Romo end the triumphs of
