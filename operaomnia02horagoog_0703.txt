HORATII FLAOGI

Qu'am per vatis opus mores animique virorum

Clarorum apparent.

Nec sermones ego mallem

250

Repentes per humum quam res componere gestas,
Terrarumque situs et flumina dicere, et arces
Montibus impositas, et barbara regna, tuisque
Auspiciis totum confecta duella per orbem,

Claustraque custodem pacis cohibentia J anum,

255

Et formidatam Parthis te principe Romam,

Si quantum cuperem possem quoque; sed neque parvum
Carmen majestas recipit tua nec meus audet

Rem tentare pudor quam vires ferre recusent.

Sedulitas autem stulte quem diligit urget,

260

Praecipue cum se numeris commendat et arte:
Discit enim citius meminitque libentius illud

Quod quis deridet, quam quod probat et veneratur.
Nil moror officium quod me gravat, ac neque ficto

251. Repenteep er humum] This is ex-
pressed by‘ pedestris! See C.‘ ιί. 12. 9, ιι.

252. arces Montibue impositae, ] See
C. iv. 14. 1⁴2. and 33, ιι. Suetonius (Aug.
21) says, “Domuit partim ductu, partim
auspiciis suis Cantabriam, Aquitaniam,
Pannoniam, Dalmatiam, cum Illyrico οιιιιιι.

The⁸ auspicium? or power of taking· the
auspices, the emperors scarcely ever dele-
gated to ‘any one. The commanders of
their armies were ‘Jduoes Tbey had not

‘imper-ium, ’and therefore could not have
⁸ auspicium)

255. ezamtraque custodem pacis colai-
beatia] That which is commonly called
the Temple of anus was a passage en-
closed between two gates leading out of the
city. A statue of Janus was placed there,
and from this and the two gates the place
was called J anus Geminus. It was built, ac.
cording to wadium, by Numa (Livy i. 19).
The gates were open in war and closed in

the battle of Actium. Ovid makes the god
explain the practice thus (Fash‘ ι. 279)= —

Horace’s explanation is that the gates were
shut during peace to prevent its guardian
from leaving the city. The first time the
gates were shut during the republic was
·A.t5.c. 519. ⁸By Augustus they were closed

three times (see C. iv. 15. 9, ιι.) aster the
battle of Actium and taking of Alexandria
A. mc. 725, and astes· the cantabr-ian war
A. u.c. 729. The third ooeasion in not
know-m Casaubon (note on Suetonius, Aug.
c. 22) says it was the year of Christ’s birth,
on the authority of Orosius, which ia not
to be trusted. Tbey mmained closed uu
the defeat of Varus A. n. 9, aster which they
were open for nearly fifty years, being ἀῦσαι
by Nero A. n. 58. They were immediately
opened again, and not closed till A. n. 71
aster the taking of Jerusalem. Tira-e· ra no
other record of the closing of these gates till
A. n. 353, when, according to Ammianus
Marcellinus (lib. κὴ), Constantius closed
them aster the defeat and death of Mag-
nentius. The practice therefore remained
under the Christian emperors.

have one’s name assodated with silly verses
or an ugly wax image, such as the admirere
of public men might think to honour them
with. Busts of literary and other distin-
guished men were put u in the public
libraries {see S. i. 4. 21, ιι. , and were pro-
