- EPISTLE III.

Anne. 734.

Iu A-uae. 734 en embassy came stom Armenia to Rome, expressing the disntisfsction
of the people with their king Artaxias, end prsying thnt Augustus would place upou·the
throne that king's younger brother Rgrnnes, who was then living in exile et Rome.
Augustus mented, und sent Tiberius with 'l'igranes to dethrone Artaxias. This Tiberius
did, and with his own hand crovmed Tigranes. Suetonius (vit. Tib. c. 14) speaks of him
es leading his srmy through Macedonia into Syrie, which pnrtly corresponds with
Horace's inquii-iem but as to Syris there must be e mistnk03 it would be entirely out
of the way. This summsry proceeding was mede the most of at Rome, though there
appears to have been little resistnnce. There was s mednl siz-uck on the occasion, with the
inscription “Armenia cnpth’ Horace speaks below (Ep. 12. 26) of the Armenian having
fallen by the vnlour of Tiberium end Velleius, the court gazetteer, says Armenio was on
that occasion reduced to the power of the Romans. It had been so virtuauy since the
submission of 'Pigranes' grandfather to Cn. Pompeius.

About his person Tiberius appears to have had a number of young men, such ns Titius,
Celsus, end Munatius, mentioned in this Epistle, und Julius Florus, ιο whom it is ed-
dressed. what little cen be said about the three firstwillbe foundinthenotes. Of
Florus Porphyrion says, ‘⁴ Fuit satirarum scriptor cujus sunt electae ex Ennio, Lucilio,
Varrone? From this Epistle (v. 23) we infer thet he was practising to become eu orator
or a jin-isconsultus, end that he wrote verses of the sostei· σοι-ις end in the second Epistle
of the second book (v. 59) we heve the seme information.

‘⁶ Cnrmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambi„
Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sele nigro.”

He may heve written Setius, but it would seem from the lest quotation that he had not
written any when Horace sent him thet Epistle. If the Seholinst is ιο be trusted (end it
is not likely he invented what he says), Florus published a selection from the old writers
mentioned by Porphyrion. Quintilian (Inst- Oret. x. 3) tells sn anecdota of one Julius
Florus, who was uncle to sn intimate ffiend of his, Julius Secundus, end whom he cells
‘⁸ in eloquentis Galliarum (quoniam ibi demum exercuit eam) princeps.” This may be
the person Horace addresses, end if so he carried out successfully the pursuit of which
Horace here supposes him to be beginning the practice. He is niso supposed by Weichert
to be the person mentioned by Tacitus (Ann. iii. ⁴0, 42) ns the leeder of an insurrection
of the Treviri, which is very improbable. How he got the gentilician neme Julius is uncer-
tain. The cognomen Florus belonged to the Aquillin gens3 end there was a 1.. Aquillius
Florus, one of the ⁴ triumviri monetdes' et this time, several of whose coins ere exunt.
Some of them ure given in the Dict. Biog. It is supposed he received the ⁶ civita ' from
Julius Csessr end took his name. But we know nothing about this. Horace hed a great
regu-d for him, as appears not only from this but the other Epistle, in which he makes
his excusoe to him for not having sent him sny poeta-y.

Florus was evidently e young man et this time, end ull the persons named were young.
One of them (Celsus) was sem-etnry to ‘libel-ius. Whether the others hed eny definite
occupationi, or were merely trevelling to enlm-ge their experience end see the world, is not
stated. Horace assumes that they are not westing their time, but pursuing their studies
and pructising their pens. He inquires aster his young friends in a wey thet shows his
interest in them, offers them such advice end eumungement ss he thinks they need, end
especially begs Florus to be reconciled to Munatius, with whom he hed for some reason
quarrelled. This was probably Horsoe's chief design in writing this Epistle.
