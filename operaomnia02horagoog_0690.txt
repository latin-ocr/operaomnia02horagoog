who had given him a good education, and
being lest destitute, became an apparitor to
the magistrates in his native town. He
afterwards served in the army, and then re-
turned home and taught. In his fiftieth
year (Α.11.0. 691) 110 came to Rome and set
up a school, which brought him more fame
than profit. He wrote a book on the ill-
treatment that teachers experienoed from
the parents of their pupils. Perhaps they
had reason to find fault with him if Horaee’ s
epithet gives a right notion of his character.
He seems to have held the rod 00 the prin-

him, and erected a marble statue to his
memory. These particulare are from Sue-
tonius' account of Orbilius in his beatiss

was in his forty-eighth year when Horace
was born. He was therefore not young
when the poet went to his school. Per·
haps Horace’s J’udgment of Livius may have
been influenced by 1110 early recollectione,
aud ‘⁶ what it then detested still abhorredss'
as a modern poet has said of Horace him-
self, “the drill'd dull lesson forced down
word by word.” Quintilian (Dial. de Orat.)
complains that in his time the old writers
were preferred to the new: “Vobis uti-
que versantur ante oculos qui Lucilium pro
Horatio et Lucretium pro Virgilio legunt,”
810. 010111 thinks the boys learnt the Latin
Ody ssey to enable them to understand the
Greek. If so Orbilius deserved an appli-
00τίοο of his own cane. He ap to have
been one os the old school, and perhaps 110
thought that pleasant learning was not good
for young 01111110, but Bentley, thinking it
improbable a schoolmester of yrepnte would
teach boys of noble birth such 1003111130 as
that of Livius, has changed Livi into

laevi, with the support of one MS.
Laevius if he existed at all) was a writer

of small cve verses and a contemp opi-ary of
cioero’ s. He has therefore no place here.

‘brings it forward,' or ‘carries the poem

sense in this word. He therefore, on the

Fabula] Atta was a writer of comedies
(wogutae’), os which a few fragments rc-
main. He died Α,11.0. 676. Τ110 title of

Itis not clear that Horace had any parti·
011101· play in mind, but it may have been
an affectation of Atta’s to have flowers seat-
tered on the stage, on which it was usual to
sprinkle a perfume exn-acted from the
crocus. See among other places Propert-
