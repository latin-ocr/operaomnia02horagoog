HORATII FLAOOI

Objiciet vere quisquam mihi, purus et insons

(Ut me collaudem) si et vivo carus amicis;

Causa fuit pater his, qui macro pauper agello
Noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere, magni
Quo pueri mugnis e centurionibus orti,

Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto,

Ibant octonis referentes Idibus aera:

Scholiasta whose commentsry eccompsuy
his own have ⁸ ηοξ though Bentley says in
sn older copy of Acron· printed st Venice
,in 1490, end in e MS. of his commenta-y
in the libra-y of the Roysl society, ⁴ tut '
appears. It is with very little doubt the
true reading, for Horace repeatedly intro-
duces ‘sut' nster ⁴ neque‚' twice repented.
Other passages ere C. iii. 23. ὃς S. i. 9. 31 3
ii. 1. 15, 2. 22. The construction with ⁴ nec’
sud ‘et' is of the sume kind, end hss been
noticed before.

71. macro pauper ayello] This mall
farm of his fsther's st Venusia was confis-
csoed during the time he wss with the srmy
of Brutus und Cassius.

72. Noluit ιἰι Flavi ludum] His sother,
who knew the velue of a good educetiom
end formed s right estimatae of Horace’s
sbilities, would not send him to s small
provincial school kept by one Flavius, where
nothing but arithmetic was taught, but
took him for his educetion to Rome, where,
though Horace complains thet the tesching
lsy chiefly in figures end the pur-suits of ι
prscticsl life (Epp. ii. 1. 10³, sqq„ Δ. Ρ.
325, sqq.)‚ there were means os acquiring ι
knowledge of literature end the erts for
those who chose to take advantage os them.
Ovid in like manner was sent from Sulmo,
his native town, to Rome. (Ti-ist. iv. 10.
16.) ⁶ Magn& ¹ magni& msy mesu ‘ big‚'
⁸ course,' contemptuously, ss Persius ssys
(S. v. 180, sqq.):

“ Dixeris haec inter varicosos centuriones ς
Continuo erasum ridet Vulfenius ingens
Et centum Graecos curto centusse licetur =”

or they msy menn ‘ importent,’ es centurione
and their sons might be in s small municipsl
town. “

74. Laevo tarpeius· loculos]
is repeated in Epp. i. l . 56. Eech boy
went to school with ι bag, in which he
oerried his books end pens, end perhaps his
‘calcidi' οι· pebbles used in calculation. The
manner of using them is conjecturslly ex-
plained in Smith's Dict. Ant„ art. ‘ Absens?
⁶ Tabulam ’ is explsined by cruquius' Scho-

lisst es signifying the ‘absens' or boerd
on which the ‘calculi ' were amaged end
the sums performed. Acron explains it
differently ss ‘⁴ buxum in quo meditentur
scribere,'' the wooden tsblet covered with
wax, for writing upon, which is the better
explanation. These country school-boys
did for themselves whst nt Rome was done
for boys of good birth by slaves ‘capsarii'
(Sueten. Clsud. 35).

‘⁴ Quisquis adhuc uno purtem colit esse
Quffinffiffflur custos angustae vernule
capsae. ' (δην. x. 116, sq.)

75. Ibant octonis] Thisverse hss caused
mitissima tamtum
Idibus ’ is not clear. The Scholissts ssy
that ⁶ octonis ' is transferred by hypallage to
‘Idibus,' sud that the sum these boys
psid their tescher wss eight asses ι mouth,
psysble on the Ides. landinus supposes
the money was paitl on the eighth ds
before the Ides of every mouth (which
would be the dsy efter the Neues, s. d.
octavum Idus), or once ι year on the Ides
of every eighth mouth. Doering cells
‘octonis ' sn ἱ· epitheton ornans,” bemuse
there were eight days between the Nones
und Ides. So Orelli and many others
understand the word, supposing ‘sere' to
be the master's stipend, and this to be pnitl
on the Ides of every mouth, or ss others

hss been given by C. F. Hermann, md
adopted by Dillenbr. snd Estre. They
suppose that ⁶ octonis mensibus ' mesns on
the Ides of eight months in the year, the
four summer months from the Ides of June
to the Ides of October being kept ss holi-
deys. They rely upon nn epigram os
Mat-tid (x. 62)=

‘⁴ Ludi magister, perce simplici turbae:
sic te frequentes audiant capillati,
Bt delicstse diligat chorus mensae,
Nec calculator nec nonu-ius velox
