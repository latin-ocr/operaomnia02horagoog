188 HORATII FLAGOI

dreamt of any thing of the sort, else they would not have failed to enrich their litei-ary
histories, in which they earefully stick in every name they can pick up, with that of this
Telephus. But it looks rather ill that this well-bred learned Greek, who lived on such
intimate terme with Horace, is never heard of in any other place. The best information
about him may be gleaned from the other two odes. Telephus is a poetieal name which
Horace uses when it suits his purpose, as here, for instance, when he wanted such an one
to give an air of individuality to an ode beginning with the humorous reproof, ⁶ You tell
us a great deal about the raee of Codrus and of Aeacus, and about the Trojan War, but as
to how, where, and on what we are to dine to-day, yon don't say a word.’” This is Butt-
mann's opinion, and 1 think any sensible man who reflecte on the subject, without pre-
conceptions of reality in his mind, will agree with him. At any rate a very slight ground-
work of truth would be enough for the part that Telephus bears in this ode, and on such
questions conjecture and time are thrown away. of the date we cau only say it was
written before ΛΑΜ). 732, for the reasons stated C. ii. lo. The season was winter (v. 8).
and the day was the first of the month (probably of the year).

Dillenbr. supposes the ode to have arisen out of the following scene.. On a cold dull
winter evening Horace is sitting in a room with some friends. Tbey are talking and
drinking without much spirit, till at last the dulness of the conversation turning upon dry
points of history, through the prosy pedantry of some one of the party, Horace can bear
it no longer, and bursts out with the eontemptuous language with which the ode begin„
then calls his friends to drink, and sets them the example. It is easy to adapt such a
scene to the ode; but there ean be little doubt, 1 think, that it is one on which Horace
bestowed more than average paine, though there is no ode in which the “ars celare artem ’'
is more conspicuous. It is impossible to suppose it the work of a moment, as Dillenbr.’s
very neat adaptation would require us to suppose. He thinks the ode is one of the early
ones, as more akin to the fire of youth than the sobriety of later life, to which remark 1
attach no importanee.

ARGUMENT.

Talk not of Codrus, and Inachus, and Trojan ware: tell us what we may get a cask ol
Chian sor, who will give us bath and house-room, and at what bour we may dine to-day.
A cup, boy, to the new moon, another to midnight, and a third to Murena the augur ς
three and nine or nine and three3 the rapt poet loves the nine; pure the Graces forbid.
Let us be mad: bring music, scatter rosea, let old neighbour Lycus and his young in-
sorted partner hear our noise and envy us. Rhode runs aster thee, Telephus, with thy
beautiful hair and bright face: as sor me, Ι am wasting with love of Glycera.
