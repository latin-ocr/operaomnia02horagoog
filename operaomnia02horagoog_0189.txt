164 HORATII FLAOGI

GARMEN VIII.

Ass, e. 729 (ἒ)

This ode was composed on the anniversa-y of Horaoe's accident with the tree (C. ii.
13), and is supposed by Franke (p. 158, sqq.) to have been written aduc. 729. His
argumentis very long, and rests chiefly on the allusioua in the fisth and aixth atanzas.
The Parthians were invaded that year by a Scythian army to restore Pbraates (C. i. 26,
Introduction). In that year Augustus hrought to an end his expedition against the
Cantabri (C. 4, lun-oduetion), and during hia sbsenoe he assumes that Maecenas was
governor of the city, as he had been ou former oeeasiona (Tae. Ami. vi. 11). He plaeea
in that year the expedition of Lentulus against the tribes of the Danube (C. ii. 9. 23),
here represented by the Dacian king Cotison. The only authority on that subject is
Florus (iv. 12), who does not give any elue ιο the date. The whole argument appears ιο
be full of doubt. Lentulus’ was not the only expedition against the northern tribea. No
mention ia any where made of Maecenas being employed aa here supposed on the ooeasiou
in question, nor does Horaoe say he was or even imply it= v. 17, ‘⁴ Mitte civiles super
urbe euras‚” might have been written to any public or thoughtful man in Rome on such
an occasion. The quarrels of the Parthians aud the subjection of the Cantabri are the two
points thet have most weight, and from those 1 should be inclined to adopt Franke’s date
(rather than others that have been proposed), which fixos those of ii. 133 ii. 17, and fur-
nishes an approximation ιο that of i. 20, as the introductiona ιο those odes will show.

ARGUMENT.

Wunder-est thou, learned friend, what this sam-ifioe means on the Kalends of March, and 1
a bechelor? On this day Ι was delivered from death, and it shall be a holiday. Come,
Maecenas, a hundred cupa of my oldest wine ιο the health of thy friend. Away with
anxiety. The Daeian has fallen, the Mede is divided against himself, the Cantabrian
iainehains and the Scythianhas unstrunghis bow. B'e here the private gentianam
never mind the people; enjoy thyaelf aud unbend.
