CARMEN XI.

Thea-e will be found iu ιιιιι md in ιιιι only other two Sapphic odes contained in ιιιιι
book more deviatione, in the proportion of nearly four ιο one, from the caesar-1 arrange-

ment oheerved in the three first books, than in all ιιιι odes of ιιιοιι books put together.
From thie and other internal evidence ιι hae been argued thatthie ode ιι a lete one, but 1
think the argumente are inconclusive. It ιι true that Horace eddi-essee Phyllis ae hie ιιιι
love, but not, ιο far ιι 1 can ece, in the tone of a percon now grown old, ιι Buttmann
suye. Μοιι men wishing to pleaee a women νον οοιιιιιιισγ ιο her, and one who was
obliged ιο confeee that he hed been inconstant to othere would only be the more vehe-
ιιιιιιι in profeeeing etedfastncee ιο her whom ιιι decii-ed for the οοαιιιοιι ιο vin. But 1
do not mean ιο expreee any decided opinion οιιι way or the other. Ῑι ιι only important
ιο bear in mind ιιιιιιιιιι book was published, not ιο revive Ηοτιοιί reputetion ιι a writer
of amatory verses, but at the desire of the emperor, who wished the praiaco of hie eoepsons
ιο be sent forth ιο the world, and ιιιι own with them. The ode ιο Lyde, on the day of
the Neptunalia (C. ιιι. 28), ιι like ιιιιι and has more spirit. Ῑι ιι not impossible Horace
may have written ιιιιι ιι early ιι the other, but thought the other better, und thet one ol
the kind was enough for publication. The form ’ spargier,⁹ which occure no where eleo
in the odes, gives ιιιιι the appearance of a different style of composition from othei-³3 but
whether this ιι (ιιιι ιο design or carelessness, or to ιιι being an early or late production,
cannot be determined. It is not at ull unlikcly, as ιοιιιι commentator has supposed, that
the ode ποι sent ιο Maecenas on ιιίι birthday, and wu only thr-own into the form of en

addi-ese ιο Phyllis for poetical convenience.
