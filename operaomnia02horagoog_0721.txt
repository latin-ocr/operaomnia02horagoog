Q. HORATII FLAOOI

DE ARTE POETICA

LIBER.

Tutus ere no internnl avinionem, at 011 fit to be wanted, of the time when this poem
was written or of the persons ω whom it is eddressed. They ere three in number, a
father und two sons. Porphyrion snd comm. Cruq. say thet the father is L. Calpurnius
Piso Caesoninus, who was Praefectus Urbi under Tiberius (Tac. Ann. vi 10). If this be so,
ns he was born in Anu-c. 705, snd hod at this time a son verging st least on msnhood (for
ιο no other would this sort of instruction be eddressed3 see v. 366), the poem must have
been written very shortly before the death of Horace, A.u.c. 746. Orelli and Kirchner,
and many others, take this view of the date. Estre, Frsnke, and many before them, put
it earlier, end in that cese a different Piso must be assumed. The person supposed by
the advocates of sn earlier date is Cn. Calpurnius Piso, who belonged to the party of
Brutus sud Cassius, end fought together with Horace nt Philippi. He lud a son who was
consul A.u.c. 747, und if he was the youth referred to the Ars Poetic- must have been
written a good many years before. But the question is one it is impossible ιο decide, md
nothing turns upon it for the undet-standing of the poem, which, likemsny others. might
be sddressed ιο any body; though 1 do not agree with those who suppose Horace had no
particular persons in mind. The Pisones above refu-red ιο ere number-ed 8, 22, 23, iu
the Dict. Biog.

As ιο the purpose of the poem 1 heve tried ιο help the render in judging for himself by
ο cereful division of the Argument. It will be seen that the rules ere misoellsneous, end
have little or no method, and thet the history of poetry which Horace gives is more
fenciful than real. It is impossible ιο look upon it es e finished poem. We ere ωτι-ἰαὶ
from precept ιο history, sud from one sort of poeti-y ιο another without nrning ς
and though n general connexion may be beced between the principles of one kind and
those of another, no psius are taken to seperate the rules that belong ιο esch. The ruloe
end history of the Drama are chiefly dwelt upon, with what particular bearing upon
Romanpoetryitisnoteesyto see. Much thetis said csnhsve norefeoenoe teitaun,
end could sfford no instruction ιο a Romnu- The observatione on this subject ere inter-
rupted now und then by irrelevant observatione, end on the whole there cun be little
doubt either thet the Ars Poetics was published nster Horace’s death, out of fragments
clumsily put together, or that he published it himself in this ceruleas wey from that
habitunl indolence which preve-ted his ever producing s complete work of any length,
and which is seen in the abruptum with which several of his pieces ure brought ιο a
close. Attempts heve been mede ιο re-errsnge the materiale so us ιο form a perfect
whole, but the means of doing so do not exist. The plsee now inverinbly esm'gned ιο the
Ars Poeties was first given it by H. stephana. In the MSS. end earlier editions it is
inserted before the Satires. Some editors uest it ns a third Epistle belonging ιο the
