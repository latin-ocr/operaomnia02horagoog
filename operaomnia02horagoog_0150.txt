Soldurii (B. G.' xii. 23), where, speaking of the
Aquitani, he says,‘ ⁴,Adcantuannus qui sum-
mam imperii tenebat cum nc devotis quos
illi Soldurios appellant, quorum haec est
conditio uti omnibus in vita commodis una
enm his ficantur quorum se amicitiae dedi-
derint· si quid ιὶι per vim accidat aut eun-
dem meum una ferant aut sibi mortem con-
sciscant: neque adbuc hominum memoria
repertus est quisquam qui eo interfecto
cujus se amicitiae devovisset mortem recu-
saret.” ‘’Carus requires‘ ipsi’ to be sup-
plied, aa (Epp. i. 3. 29)· ‘Si patriae volumus,
si nobis vivere cari.' ⁶1 shall love myselt'

been unrmonably surmised, from this co-

‘Gigas,' and interpret⁴ Briareus. ’ Bentley
says all his MSS. have that reading, which
has probably arisen out of· Gygasl the
Doric form of· Gy g,es 'which occurs in some
MSS. The MSSg of Hesiod vary between

Γύης and Γύγης, as in—

Κὸττος τε Βριάρευς τε Γύης r' ἄατος
πολέμοιο. (Theog. 714.)

Commenting on which line, Buttmann (Lex.
p. 2,1ἥι1ι1ι1ω) says he thinks Γύης is the
m-igiml and more correct f,orm being a
form of γυῖον. He considers that Γύγης
is a corruption arising out of the Lydian
name, which Horace has adopted (C. ii. ὗ.
2ος iii. 7. ὁ), the first syllable of which is
long, and that is au argument against this
form. On Buttmann' s authority 1 have
adopted ⁶ Gyas,' which Orelli also prefers
(though his oldest MSS. have ⁴ Gffl,
both here and at iii. 4. 69. Bentley s

‘,Gyges' but rather argues against it. Isam-
binus had originally adopted that reading,
but his opinion was c by the above
objection about the quantity, which Bentley
notices as if it were his own. Landinus
and Ascensius follow the Scholiasta, though
the former, quoting Hesiod in his Commen-
tary, gives ‘Gyas' as the name of Briareus’
brother. Stephenshas‘Gyas,’Cru uius‘Gi-
gas,’ in deference to all his MSS. 2including
the Blandinian3 so that all the oldest MSS.

reading). of the editors 1 have compared

daughters of Zeus and Themis, and the

does not say why.

17. Seu Libra] What Horace thought
of asnology may be collected from C. i. 11.
He introduces a little of it here to entertain
his friend, showing, at the same time. but
little care or knowledge οἱ the subject, and
rather a contempt for it.
