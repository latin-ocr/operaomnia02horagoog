HORATII FLACOI

Quid vetat et nosmet Lucili scripta legentes
Quaerere, num illius, num rerum dura negarit
Versiculos natura magis factos et euntes
Mollius ac si quis pedibus quid claudere senis,

Hoc tantum contentae, amet scripsisse ducentos

60

Ante cibum versus, totidem coenatus; Etrusci
Quale fuit Cassi rapido ferventius amni
Ingenium, capsis quem fama est esse librisque
Ambustum propriis! Fuerit Lucilius, inquam,

Geniis et urbanus, fuerit lima-tior idem

Quam rudis ·et Graecis intacti carminis auctor,

fair spirit of criticism the poete thet heve
gone before him.

59. ae η’ quis] 1 do not know why
Orelli limite this use of ⁴ ac ' after words of
comparison to the poets. It is not less em·
ployed in prose. (See S. l. 46, n.) Horace
says he is et liberty to inquire whether it is
not a natural consequence of Lucilius’ tem-
perament, end the character of his subjecte,
that he wrote verses not more polished and
smooth than might be expected of a man who
was content with giving his lines the proper
number of feet, end took delight in string-
2233235‘333..t1{ttz¹f¹''flbssztiss‘2352&
dere senis ⁹ 1 understand to explain ⁸ hoc,'
contented merely with this, that is to say,
comprising something (thet he cells a verse,
for there is contempt in ‘ quid ’) in six feet.
Bentley puts ⁴ hoc tantum ¹ in 11 parenthesiS,
which is unnecoesary. ⁴ At,’ which is the
reading of some of the old editions and of

poses in his chronological scheme that the
first book of the Satires was finished in mmo.
717. Aci-on says his books were burnt with
his body, by order of the senate3 confound-
ing him with Cassius Severus (mentioned
on Epod. vi„ Int.), in respect to whom we
read in Suetonius (Celig. c. 16) thet such a
decree was passed. In this confusion of
names we only see thet the Scholiasta
knew nothing about the Etrus-ian Cassius,
end it is useless for us to attempt to leam
more 01Ι him then that he was in Horsoe's
opinion? spelcimetsspf that low class of poete
w om e is esen ing.

63. capric] See S. 4. 22, n.

64. Fuerit] See S. i. 1. 45.

66. Quam rudis et Graecis] Allow that
he is more polished than es the inventor of
11 new style of writing unknown to the
Greeks he appears to be, and then the mass
of the older poets certainly ore. What
Horace means to say is, thet Lucilius, from

Lambinus, and ‘an ’ the conjecture of ·the novelty of his style, may possibly be

Dacier and Doering, ere bad substitutes for
⁴ nc,' and give no sense that 1 cen understand.

61. Etrusci Quale suit Cassi] Of this
Cassius we know nothing, and what Horace
says of him is no more than s 500111111- inven-
tion thet his writings were of so little velue
that they were burnt on the same funeral pile
with his body, or, es he seems to mean, that
there was enough of them to form 11 fimerel
pile of themselves. The Scholiasts all oon-
found him with Cassius of Parma mentioned
Epp. i. 4. 3, where see notet end many edi·
tors follow them, forgetting that Parma was
not en Etrurian town, but belonged to the
Boii in Cisalpine· Gaul. Bentley again
‘⁴ sue vineta caedit '’ (see C. iv. 12, Int.), for
Cassius of Parme was put to death by order
of Augustus efter the battle of Actium (in
which he took pert with M. Antonius),
i. e. in mmo. 7233 whereas Bentley sup-

judged unfairly, and may possess moro
besuties and even elegancies than ere 111-
lowed him; but still there cen be no doubt,
if he had lived to thet time, he would bave
corrected many expressions and gone to 11
good deal of trouble in polishing his verses-
The commentatore have given a variety os
interpretatione from the Scholiasts down-
wards‚ which Orelli hes collected. The
above appears to be the true one. It
agrees with Heindorf's explanation, end is
the substance of 11 paper on the subject by
C. F. Hermann, which Orelli quotes with
approbation. The MSS. end editions vary
between ⁴ dilatus ’ end ⁸ delatus‚' ⁸ dilapsus ’
end ‘ delapsus.² The first is more generally
adopted. It means properly ⁶ deferred,'
had his birth been put off till now. ‘ De·
latus’ would mean, had his life been con-
tinued, brought down to the present time.
