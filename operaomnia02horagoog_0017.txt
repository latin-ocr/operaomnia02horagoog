xvi INTRODUGTION.

book, of which one or two poema are among Horace’s earliest composi-
tions, may have been published in Α.11.ο. ’7 24. In that year was written,
as it would seem, the sixth Satire of the second book, which book
therefore was not probably published till the 01111 of '7 24 or the beginning
of the next yem, when Horace was about thirty-five years old.

When Augustus returned from Asia, in Α.11.0. 725, and closed the
gates of J anus, being the acknowledged head of the republic, Horace
appeared amongst his most hearty adherente. He wrote on this occasion
one of his best Odes (i. 2), and employed his pen in forwarding those
reforma which it was the first object of Augustus to effect. (See Intro·
duction to O. 11. 15.) His most striking Odes appear for the most part
to have been written after the establishment of peace. Some may have
been written before, and probably were. But for some reason it would
seem that he gave himself more to lyric poetry after his thirty-fifth year
than he had done before. He had most likely studied the Greek poeta
while he was at Athens, and some of his imitatione may have been
written early. If so, they were most probably improved and polished
from time to time (for he must have had them by him, known perhaps
only to a few friends, for many years) till they became the graceful
specimens of artificial composition that they are. Horace continued to
employ himself in this kind of writing (011 a variety of subjecta, con-
vivial, amatory, political, morah some original, many no doubt suggested
by Greek poema) till A.tr.c. 730, when Ι 8111 inclined to think the three
first books of the Odes were published. I cannot here discuss the
subject, but Ι have considered ‘and stated 111 the case of each Ode the
evidenees, if any, that it contains of its date, and Ι 0811 find none which
may not be placed in that year or before it. Bentley’s theory, which
limits Horace to one species of composition at a time, and supposes each
of the three first books of Odes to have been published separately, I have
no faith in; and he overlooks the fact that the twenty-fourth Ode of the
first book was certainly written four years after that in which he places
the publication of that book. Olinton, who supporta Bentley (Fast. Hell.
11.0. 38), 0811 only do so by supposing that 111 the present copies some
pieces may have been transposed, which is begging the question.
Franke 1188 arrived, as far as Ι 0811 judge, at the right conclusion upon
this subject. During this period Horace appears to have passed 1118
time at Rome among the most distinguished 111011 of the day, or at his
house in the country, paying occasional visits to Tibur, Praeneste,
81111 Baiae, with indifferent health, which required change of air.
About the year A. 11. 0. '728 he was nearly killed by the falling of a
tree, on his own estate, which accident he has recorded 111 0110 of his
Odes (11. 13), 81111 occasionally refers to; once in the same stanza with a
