SATIRARUM I. 8.

Hic dabat: Heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.
Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus atque

Aggere in aprico spatiari, quo modo tristes

Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum3
Cum mihi non tantum furesque feraeque suetae
Hunc vexare locum curae sunt atque labori,

Quantum ,carminibus quae versant atque venenis

Humanos animos. Has nullo perdere possum

Nec prohibere mode, simul ac vaga luna decorum
Protulit oe, quin ossa legant herbasque nocentes.

300 in depth. ‘In fronte' means facing
the public rond, the Via Tiburtina 6. 108),
or the Via Praenestina, one of w ⁰ch, or
both, must have passed very close to it. (See
Caesar, B. G. ii. Β, and Mr. Long’s note).
It was usual to engrave on monuments the
following letters, n. n. Η. Ν. s., which
stand for ‘⁴ Hoc monumentum heredes

length. Sometimes ax r. (ex testamento)
were inserted between n. and N. Lam-
binus has given four inscriptions, copied by
himself, from ancient sepulchres‚ of which
the following he found in Rome z—nus

'rho others are of like import; that is to
say, they specify for whose particular use
the sepulchre was built, and provide against
its going, with the rest of the man's pro-
perty, to his herodes. Such sepulchres
were called ⁴ sepulchra familiaria ς’ those
that were built for a man and his heirs were
called ‘hereditaria’ Horace writes as if
there were a stone set up on some part of
the boundary of this burial-ground, with
the inscription usual on private monuments,
n. u. n. N. s., which is obviously only a
satire. The words could only apply to a
private place of burial. All he really means
is, that a space of ground of the extent he
mentions was marked ofl' for the burial of
these poor people. For other examples of
such inscriptions, see Fabi-etti Insc. Ant-iq.
&c.‚ Explic. Romae, 1699.

14. Nunc licet Esquiliis] The whole of
the Esquiline or fifth region of Rome, was

called Esquiliae. This from having been

tm. ³353 ffessssntpffifflft '532¹'AEss
tells us that Augustus, when he was ill, went
to Maecenas' house in the Esquiliae to re-
cruit (Octav. c. 72). The ⁴ agger ' here
referred to was a raised terrace commenced
by Servius ΤιιΙΙίιιε, and carried by him from
the Porta Collina to the Porta Esquilina.
It was continued (according to Cramer, who
quotes Dion Halic. iv. 54) by Tarquinius
Priscus as far as the Porta Querquetulana,
being in all about twelve stadia, and about
fifty feet in breadth. It thus skirted on
the east the whole of the fifth or Esquiline
quarter3 and the sixth‚ which had its name
Alta Semita from this great work. Here
the Romans walked in cold westher to get
the sun, and had a full view of the pestilent
plain which Maecenas converted into a
paradise. Juvenal calls it ‘ventosus’ (S.
viii. 43). Bentley edits ⁴ qua’ in v. 15, and
is followed by some editors. It is against
all the MSS. and older editions, and ‘ quo,'
in the sense of ⁸ ex quo,’ will do very
well.

17. Cum milas· non tantum] ‘ Cum’ is
thus connected with what goes before.
Priapus says the lomlity is now made
healthy. and the citizens may take their
walk without being sickened with the sight
of bones bleaching upon the plain, whereas
his vexations still remain‚—-the driving away
of thieves and wild animals which still fre-
quented the spot, and yet worse the punish-
ment and scaring away of the witches who
there continued to carry on their abominable
practices. We need not infer with Dacier
that the place was not yet entirely changed
or cleared of the bones that disfigured it,
but may suppose the witches still continued
from habit to haunt the scene of their ini-
quities, and that the ‘fiires ' and ‘ferae,’
are the depredators that came to rob the
gardens which were the god’s particular
care. 1 am not aware of any other instance
of ‘ suetus ’ being used as a trisyllable.
