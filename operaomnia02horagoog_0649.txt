HORATH FLACCI

N a perconteris fundus meus, optime Quinti,

Arvo pascat herum an baccis opulentet olivae,

Pomisne et pratis an amicta vitibus ulmo,

Scribetur tibi forma loquaciter et situs agri.

Continui montes ni dissocientur opaca 5
Valle, sed ut veniens dextrum latus adspiciat Sol,

Laevum discedens curru fugiente vaporet.

1. fiendas] See S. ii. 5. 108, u.

2. Arno pascat herum] Horace had
some of his land under his own cultivatiom
but it was 110 great quantity, as we may
infer from the number of slaves employed
upon it (S. ii. 7. 118). Τ110 rest he seems
to have let (Epp. 14. 2, n.). Part of his
land was arable and part of it meadow
(Epp. 15. 26-30, and C. iii. 16. 30, “ segetis
certa fides meae '’). He hadagarden (Epp.
14. 42 . He must also have had vines
(28, n. . In short, it was au ordinary farm
on a small scale. The second and third
verses, though not put directly as a descrip-
tiou, are so to be understood 1 think. Ho-
race recounts the different productione ot*
his farm, while he supposes Quintius to ask
about them3 otherwise, as de Chaupy says
(vol. i. p. 357), the subsequent description is
meagre enough, and all we learn is that the
land produced wild cherries, plums, and
acorna.

— opulentet] This word does not occur
in any earlier writer. Porcellini produces
only one other instance, from Columella.

3. an amicta vitibus alnum] See C. ii.
15. 5: “ platanusque caelebs Evincet ul-
mos.” The render may be intel-ested in
what de Chaupy saw: “Je remarquerai
sur les vig-nes, qu'elles y on conserve la
forme antique peinte par Horace, qui con-
siste a y &tre exactement mariees aux or-
meaux. Dans la Vallee de Licence 01 dans
le reste 110 la Sabine antique en effet les
vignes sont eu ce qu’on appelle Alberetti.
On plante en meme tems, et on taille en-
suite daus la meme saison le cep, qui forme
la vigne et l'ormeau qui doit l'elever et
l’appuier= les deux plantes croissent et
vivent ainsi ensemble avec un sort si uni,
que de meme que l'ormeau devient inutile
lorsqu’il perd la vigne, ainsi la vigne reste
quasi saus ressource si l’arbre qui lui sert
d’appui vient ὲ mourir” (iii. 545). He
says the olive is less cultivated in this valley
than it might be, 111 consequence of the
large quantity that is grown at Rvoli.
Other fruits, he says, continue abundant
and good in the valley of Licenza. He

Quid, si rubicunda benigni

also speaks of the oak and holm oak (lc
chene vert), and the wild plum and wild
cherry (⁴ cornus '), ss growing every where.

cute the vast range of mountains extending
from the Campagna above Tibur 10 Carseoli,
about forty-five miles from Rome. With-
out this valley, he says, this immense body
would be a continuous mass. The valley
is not formed by a simple depressior: of the
mountains, but they seem to open down 10
their foundations to produce it. 'nnis 110
thinks gives more force to the word ‘ late-
brae ' in v. 15. The valley, he says, seems
10 have neither entrance nor exit. It lies
nearl north and south, which cur-re-
spon with the description of the text.
De Chaupy professes to have found the
ruins of Horace’s house on the western
side of this valley, its aspect being chiefly
east. But there is not much reliance ω
110 placed 011 this, and the map he lm
given is likely to mislead, the points of
the compass being inaccurately marked. A
writer quoted by Obbarius, and said by him
to have investigated these localities before De
Chaupy (Ger. Heerken’s Notabil. l. ii. p. 31)
says: ‘⁴ circumspiciens aliquamdiu monte·
oculis dimensus sum qui multo dumo virides
vallem videbantur quinque millium inclu-
dere.” This corresponds with De Chaupy's
account and the rough map he gives of the
country. The Scholiasta Acron and Comm-
cruq. say that both the valley and one of
gie rqountains was called Ustica3 but see

8. {lembum laudea] The position oi
the valley, De Chaupy says, keeps it cool
in summer and warm in winter, the latter
by the exclusion of the north wind (Tra-
montana). The Scirocoo (⁴ plumbeus Aus-
ter ’) he says is either excluded altogether,
or the little of it that penetrates 1110 11101111-
tains is so purged of its noxious qualitioe
on the way that it does no barm.
