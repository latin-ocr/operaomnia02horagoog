Privatus illis census erat brevis,
Commune magnum: nulla decempedis
Metata privatis opacam 15
Porticus excipiebat Arcton,
Nec fortuitum spernere caespitem
Leges sinebant, oppida publico
Sumptu jubentes et deorum
Templa novo decorare saxo.

CARM EN XVI.

After A. u, e. 720.

There are no means of fixing the date of this ode. It was written, however, aster
Horace had come into possession ot· his farm, to which he refers (v. 37). The person
Pompeius Grosphus, to whom the ode is addressed was, according to Porphyrion, of the
equasti-ian order. He was possessed of large property in Sicily, of which island he was
probably a native. On his return Horace gave him a letter of introduction to his friend
Iccius (Epp. i. 12), in which he speaks highly of his worth. Cicero mentions a Sicilian
Eubulides, who bore the sui-name of Grosphus, a man οῖ high character and birth, and
great wealth (in Verr. ii. 3. 23). Estre supposes (p. 473) that this Grosphus was made
a Roman citizen by Cn. Pompeius, and took his name, which descended to Horace's friend,
his aon or grandson. He is not to be confounded (aa J ani and others confound him)
with the Pompeius of C. ii. 7 (Introduction). He appears, from the latter part os the
ode, to have been in Sicily when it was written. Perhaps he hail written Horace a letter
which called up the particular train of thought that runs through the ode, or had qnalities
which made it applicable to him.

ARGUMENT.
The sailor and the aavage warrior alike pray for rest, bnt wealth cannot buy it. Riches
