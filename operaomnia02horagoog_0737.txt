HORATII FLAOGI

165

Conversis studiis aetas animusque virilis

Quaerit opes et amicitiae, inservit honori,
commisisse cavet quod mox mutare laboret.
Multa senem circumveniunt incommoda, vel quod

Quaerit et inventis miser abstinet ac timet uti,

Vel quod res omnes timide gelideque ministrat,
Dilator‚ spe longus, iners, avidusque futuri,
Difficilis, querulae, laudator temporis acti

Se puer0‚ castigator censorque minorum.

Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum,
Ne forte seniles

Multa recedentes adimunt.

175

Mandentur juveni partes pueroque viriles,
Semper in adjunctis aevoque morabimur aptis·
Aut agitur res in scenis aut acta refertur.

Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,

180

Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quae
Ipse sibi tradit spectator: non tamen intus
Digna geri promes in scenam, multaque tolles
Ex oculis quae mox narret facundia praeseus.

172. spe loaysa] “Quia tardus est et
difficilis ad sperandum, propter experien-
tiam fallacis fortunae ’⁹ (Forcellini). The
expression is peculiar, and other interpre-
tations have been given, but 1 believe that
this is the true one. So Dacier rendere it,
“longus ὃ concevoir des esperances.” Bent-
le5 substitutes ‘lentus ’ ont of his own
head. ⁶ Avidus futuri ' means I suppose
⁴ sager to live longer,' or ‘greedy of life‚’ but
it is an odd expression.

175. Multa serunt anni] See C. ii. ὅ.
14, n., and Epp. ii. 2. 65. The remark
seems to be drawn forth by the dark picture
of old age contained in the preceding verses.
It has not much otherwise to do with the
subject.

178. aaeijnmctt'e aevoque morabimur aptit]
Both ‘adjunctis’ and ‘aptis' go with ‘aevo,’
⁶ we shall dwell upon that which attaches
and is fitted to the age we have in hand!

179. aut acta refertum] The following
remarks of Miiller (Hist. Gr. Lit. i. 307)
appear te be true :--“ The actions to which
no speech is attached, and which do not
serve to develope thoughts and feelings, are
imagined to pass behind or without the
scene, and are only related on the stage.
Hence the importunos of the parts os mes-
sengers and heralde in ancient
poet was not influenced only by the reason

also the far deeper general reason, that it is
never the outward act with which the inter·
est of ancient ffagedy is most infimately
bound up. The action is interna! and spiri-
tual3 the reflectione, resolutione, feelings,
the mental or moral phenomens which mn
be expressed in speech, are developed on
the stage. For outward action, which is
generally mute or at all events cannot be
adequately expiessed by words, the Epic
form, nan-afion, is the only appropriate
vehicle. Moreover, the costuma of trag-ic
actore was calculated for impressive decla-
mation and not for action. The lengthened
and stuffed out figures would have had an
awkward, not to say a ludicrous effect in
comb'at or other violent action. From the
sublime to the ridiculous would have been
but one step, which ancient tragedy care-
fully avoided risking.”

180. Seynius {rr-itant mimos] When
Candaules proposes to exhibit his wife's
beauty to Gyges, Herodotus (i. 8) makes
him say, ὦτα γὰρ τυγχάνει ἀνθρώποισι
ἐόντα ἀπιστότερα ὀφθαλμῶν, and Seneca
(Epp. vi.) has a like saying, ‘⁸ Homines
amplius oculis quam auribus aeduum
