HORATIl FLAOGI

Aut ob avaritiam aut misera ambitione laborat.

Hunc capit argenti splendor; stupet Albius aere;

Scholiasta hsd ⁴ elige,' and thet is the reed-
ing of Ven. 1483. The earliest edition that
has ‘erue' appears ιο be thst of Aldus
(1501), from which time ull the editors, 1
believe, adopted it till Tslbot returned ιο
the old reading, which Bentley adopts, but
mudders it may be s glou, end substituted
for ⁴ arripe,' which he proposes. Three of
the Blendinisn MSS. hed ⁴ eripe,' which he
thinks supports his conjecture. Ssnsdon
sdopts ⁴ arripe? though its author does not.
Itis difficult to decide. ‘Erue' is sn un-
likely word to heve been coined‚ und ⁴ elige ⁹
would form s good gloss upon it. ⁴ Emere ’
would signify ⁴ digging out,' or bringing out
something hidden, ss in Lucret. (v. 279)²

nion, lies between ⁴ erue ⁹ und ⁴ elige.’ und

says, ⁴⁴ Miserrime est omnino ambitio ho·

fore seems to have been hebitusl. which, if
we consider the evils that arose out of per-
sonsl ambition, sud the engerness with
which places of honour were sought st au
times of the Republic‚ is not surprising.

perty through his son's extravagance, in
respect of which missortune Horace wrote
the Epistle i. 4. to comfort him. This is
mere txifling: though Tibullus mentions
