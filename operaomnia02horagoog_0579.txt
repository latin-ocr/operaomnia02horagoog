Nec sequar aut fugiam quae diligit. ipse vel odit,
Olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni

Respondit referam: Quia me vestigia terrent,

Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.

Pars hominum gestit conducere publica, sunt qui

Orustis et pomis viduas venentur avarae,

Excipiantque senes quos in vivaria mitt-anm

Multis occulto crescit res fenore.

none hed survived or recovered their right

Aesop in his conversation with Alcibiades,
to illustrate the wealth of Lacedaemon, into
