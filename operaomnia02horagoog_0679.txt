was not necessary is plain from Augustus’ generosity to virgil end Varius, notieetl in
v. 235, md from the intimacy on the strength of which he was ennbled to write to the
great men et ell in this strein. The parts of the Epistle do not hang together very
closely, especially efter the first ninety lines. They eonsist of compliments to Augusta„
e remonstrence about the pati-onage bestowed on the old poets; e desa-iption of tie
repid growth of art in Greeee after the Persian παι-ς a complaint that every body-tt
Rome hes taken to writing verses, whether they cen or nog a commendatior· of poeta
ns good end useful citizens end contributors to the nationsl piety; ι history off ὼε
growth of poetry in Italy· e comperison between trsgedy end comedy, and ι mea-a:
Plautus end another31m account of the troubles of dremntic authors through the aprina
end bed teste of their audienees, which et that time is stated to have been especially

depraved3 en eppeal to Augustus on behslf of the poets of the dey; and a. reproof te
such poets es are unreesoneble or officione, and attempt themes too exelted sor them.

How much foundation there may have been for Hornoe’ s remarks about the eompara-
tive support given to the old writers end the new it is hard to say. There appare to be
e little contradiction between this alleged neglect end the universal menie for seribhling
which he describes 3 or else the proflision of bed verses may itself account for the prde-
ence of those who did not write, sor the genius of former days. Horace has not a wod
to say for Plautus or for Terence, but rather sneers at the popular judgment of them.
We may safely say therefore thet this Epistle is worth nothing in point of critidsm, end
thet it does notrnise Horeeevery high aseguideto the testes of others. Itis possible
eu efl'ectnfion of preference for the erchaic in language my heve prenssed in smne
quartern- but Horaoe’ s censure effecte those who on sound principles of teste preferred
the vigour of the old writers to the weakness of the new.1n short, there· is no dina-imin-
tion in his stetement of the cese, in which therefore 1 do not find it ειη to follmv him.

There is much polish in the versifioetion of this Epistle. The ssuttery with which it
opens is cleverly written, end the verses towards the end, in which Hor-noe compendiously
states the military successes of Augustus, ere terso end elegant. His commendationi of
the poet is s fuir tribute to his own profession. The description of the vulger tute for
spectacles is natural, end reminds us of our own timon end there is enough in the Epist-le
to neeount for the high estimetion it is held in by the general render.

ARGUMENT.

It would be unperdonsble in me to detein you, Ο Caesar, ebeni-bed ns you tre in the
weightiest cares. Romulus end Liber, the sons of Leda end Hercula, thone bene-
factore of mankind, received not while alive the honour due to their great denda: they
were euvied then, but are worshipped now, for greetness scorches those below it3 but
when its light is removed, then it is admired. To you, on the other hand, we render
our homage, even while you ure with us, and ncknowledge that yomequalhn not bem,
and never shall be. ·

(v. 18.) But they who ere herein so wiso, ere not wise in this, thet they like nothing but
what is gone. Such admirere ure they of what is old that they declaro the ΧΠ Tabia
of the lawe, the old kings’ treeties, the pontiflcel books, end the velumes of the nudent
herde, to have J>een inspired by the Alban Muse- But if the same mle ie to be
applied to the Romans ss to the Greeks, whose oldest poet· no doubt ere their best,
then forewell to our nenses. No doubt our painting, our music, our wrestling, nebetta·
then the Greeks' 1

(v. ³4.) But if time acts on poetry as it does on wine, what number of years ere re-
