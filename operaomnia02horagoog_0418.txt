SATIRARUM I. 6.

Nos facere a volgo longe longeque remotos?
Namque esto populus Laevino mallet honorem

Quam Decio mandare novo, censorque moveret

Appius ingenuo si non essem patre natus:
Vel merito quoniam in propria non pelle quiessem.
Sed fulgente trahit constrictos Gloria curru

Titius, et sex fere annis possedit, et longe
longeque rem meliorem fecit. ” The repeti-
tion is only analogous, as Bentley says, to

as by their official rank were entitled to be
senators. This they did at their own dis-
aetion sor various offences by which⁴ igno-

many others ιιι the Latin langnage, as minia' was liable ιο be ineurred, or from the

Βῗκαιῗιῗπῗε the lle-st ‹8th adopt‘ *Ιοιιὲἒῃῑςέιιιιιιέοε-

19. Namque esto] He goes on to show
that though the value set upon titles and
birth by the populace might be exeggented,
yet the other extreme is not to be allowed ς
end thet he who seeks to push himself
beyond his sphere might be justly rebuked
for his presumption.

20. Quam Decio mandare neem] P. De-
cius Mus, who devoted himself to death sor
his country at the battle of Vesuvius ιιι the
Latin war, mmo. 414, was the first consul
of his family. He held the office with
Τ. Manlius Torquatus in that year. Aster
the curule magistrscies were opened ιο the
plebeiam, an order of nobility sprung up

any member had ever held a curule office
were ⁴ nobiles,’ the rest ‘ ignobiles,’ and he ιιι
whose person such dignity was first attained
was called, originally no doubt through the
contempt of the pstricisns, but esterwerds
conventionally by all, ‘ novus homo! The
Decia gens was plebeiau.

censorque moveret Appius] The Appius
who is here taken as the type of severe
censorship is Appius Claudius Caecus, the
constructor of the road end aqueduct that
bore his name. He was mede Censor A.u.c.
442. It was the province of the censore,
tiu that office was merged in the imperial
power, to supply vacencies ιιι the senate from
the list of those who were eligible‚ who were
all citizens of at least equestrian rank, of
not less than s certain age (which we do
not know exactly, but it wes between thirty
and fo rty), and those persons who had
served ιιι the principal magistracies. But
they could also, in revising the list of
senators at the beginning of their censor-
ship, degrsde those who had previously
been' ιιι the senate, es well es exclude such

senator having been chosen improperly.
They effectedg this exclusion merely by
marking the name, end their marky was
called ⁴ nota censoria! Horace, therefore,
means that ιι· he, through the favour of
Maecenas or other means, sought ss a
freedmsn's son to resch the dignity of a
senator, snd succeeded, the censore, if they
did their duty strictly, would degi-ade him.
The censor Appius however is notorious
for his laxity ιιι having chosen for party
purposes the sons of freedmen and other
unqualified people into the senate. But he
was harah and arbitrary ιιι the exercise οἱ
his office, and his name was proverbial ιιι
connexion with the censorship, which is
enough to account for his appearance here.
There was no money qualificatiou for the
senate, but only one of rank. ⁴ Movere'
is the technicul word for degreding a senator,
end those who were degraded or not ad-
mitted were called ‘ praeteriti senstores’
from the circumstance of their being merely
passed by when the lists were made out,
end their names not app ear-ing, which
would prevent them from acting. (See
DictAnt.,.arts‘Senatus,'‘,’Cens01-es‘nota
Censoris. ') ‘In propris non pelle qui-
essem' is the old story of the ass ιιι the
lion' s skin.

23. Sed fhlyente trahit] This verse
may or may not be taken from some heroic
poem. It is introduced humorously, end
yet with a serious meaning. ⁴ Let the
ggssezltlgeansdtleltzhtehle ξοθιῗέοξειιιιξὲἒο ἷζὲιιιέἓιΐ
standard for the senate, yet the humbly
born may have their honours ss well ς’ thet
is, the honours thet srise from virtue and
genius. The picture of Glory mounted on
her car is repeated in Epp. ιι. 1 177, where
the epithet ⁴ fulgente ' is exchanged for

‘ventos0,’ fickle as the winds.’ As observed
before (C. S. 67, ιι.), ‘ Gloria ' eppesrsin the
ancient descriptione ιιι two characters, good

and bad. In the former she is represented
by Honos.
