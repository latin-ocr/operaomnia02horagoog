EPODON LIBER, 3. 279

CARMEN III.
Between A.U.C. 718—721.

Horeee here vente his wretb against some guliel: he hul esten the day before et
Mneeenns' table, end which had dingreed with him. He seems to imply that Maecenas
had played off e praetiosi joke upon hin, end tho whole Epode is full ot humour end
familia-ity. Thin lende to the· supposition thet it πω not written very early in their
acquaintance, while from the het two verses it hes been justly inferred thet it was written
before Maecenas was manieti to Terentia, or in love with her, since the notion suggested
by Acron (not as his own however), that Terentia is there nlluded to, is ont of the
question. But, for reasons that viu be stated in Epod. xiv„ Introduction, it is probnble
that Mneeenns wne married, or in love with his future wife, in teme. 721. This ode πυ
therefore written in nll probability some time between 718 end 721.
