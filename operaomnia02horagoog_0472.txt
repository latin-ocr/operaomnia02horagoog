SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 2. 447

eooking must heve been brought to great perfeetion iu the course of thst period during
which eeting end drinking wus the chief feature in u Romen‘s dsyg but Horace probably
had only seen it in its infsney. Juvenal end Martini ure more fun in their account of it.
Ple-h, fisi), and fowl, end mede dishes of every kind, were imported from sll quurters. 'I'he
nrt of digestion was ss much studied es the nrt of the kitchen, but diseeses of eourse
multiplied. convivial musements were necessarily invented to beguile these long mesls;
the seienee of conversation flourished, end small talk was e trade, professionnl diuers-out
(⁶ parasiti ') being required to keep the company alive whenevm· their own resouroes
failed. This deflection from the simplieity οἰ early dsys is e mehneholy festum in the
history of the Empire3 but it required perhaps a sti-unger und sternet pen than Horeoe's
to handle it thoroughly. This Satire, the fourth, end the eighth, throw some light on
culinsry detsils3 but the viee of gluttony‚ which must heve gone numida-able lengths even
st this time, might heve been more vigorously sttseked. It forms no pert of the cor-
ruptions pointed ont for reformatiou in the odes. Hei-soe himself, though abstemious in
his own appetite, dined s good deul with the rich, and msy not heve thought it expedient
or grsdous ιο att-ck them on such u point.

ARGUMENT.

The velue of n moderate fere come leem from me (on the authority of the plain sensible
Ofella), not with the glitter of plste in your eyes, but now, before you heve broken
your fast. He who would judge truly must heve sn unbisssed judgment.

(v. 9.) Go, get up your appetite with hunting or bell-play or the quoit, und then see whether
you will despise humble fere md rejeet the drink that is not mingled with Hymettisu
honey. If the butler is ebroad end no fish is to be hed, your belly will be content with
dry breed end sslt. How is this? Why the pleusure of eeting does not lie in the
ssvour of the mest, but in yourself. laet lebour supply you with ηοω. 'rho most
tempting duinties give no plensure to the bloated stomach. Yet seuroe any argument
will prevent your prefer-ring s peeeoek to e burn-door fowl, merely because it hee s fine
teil, end eosts more money. How oen you tell where that fish was caught? You
delight in u mullet of three pounds weight, sud yet you must cut it into fragments to
serve it to your friends. But why then don’t you like the big lupus? Why, because
the one is big by nature, the other small, end you like what is unnaturul end rare. The
hungry belly, on the other hund, seldom despises s thing beoeuse it is common. “ Ι
like to see s huge beust stretched out on e huge dish,” ssys the glutton. Blow south
winde end rot their dsinties 1 But let them alone, they ure es good us rotten already
for appetites that went rather stimulante thsn food. But these luxuries ure only of
late growth, end some day we shall have ronst gulls in feshion.

(v. 53.) But moderatiori is not meenness, end it is of no use ιο avoid one fault only ιο
fau into another. Avidienus puts old fruit sud sour wine before his friends, end is
stingy of his stinking eil, even on holidsys. Which would you rather imitate? Re·
spectability lies in s middle course, avoiding excessivo siu-ietness, but equally svoiding a
slovenly carelessness.

(v. 70.) Now Ι will tell you the edmtsges of moderate fere. In the first phoe it eon.
duoes ιο hedui, as you osu easily tell, if you think how well your fond agreed with you
till you mixed up ull manner of things in your stomsch. How pale e mun gete up from
n mixed supper! Let the belly be oppressed with debsuch end the soul is oppressed
likewise. Another men takes e hem-ty supper, goes ιο bed early, und gete up equnl ιο
the duties of the dsy3 end he, if s holidsy onmes round or siokness or ege requires
extre indulgence, may indulge himself with impunity= but what eun you edd ιο the
indulgence you sntidpsoe in your early days? Our moestum, beut on hospitality, kept
