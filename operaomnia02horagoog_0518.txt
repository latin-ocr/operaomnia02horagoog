ones, and the spring was the best season
for them. See Martial (xiii. ⁴3)-

“Lecta suburbanis mittuntur apyrina ramis
Et vernae tuberes: quid tibi cum

But all such fungi had to be chonen with
great care. Even the boletus served to
carry off an emperor. See Juvenal, 1. ο..
and Martial i. 21.

2⁴. Aufidius] Estne thinks thia may be
M. Aufidius, who was remarkable as having
been the first at Rome who bned and fat-
tened peacocks for sale, and derived a large
profit (as much as 600, 000 sesterces a year)
from that trade. (Pliny, N. H. x. 20. 23·
vamdeRR.iii.6. 1.) Thispersonia
aleo identified with Μ. Aufidius Lurco, who
was tribune of the plebs Α.ιι.ο. 693, and
author of the Lex Aufidia de Ambitu.
(See his Life in the Dict. Biog.) I am not
avare that there are sufficient grounds for
either-of these oenjecturea. Aa to the com·
position of ⁸ mulsum ³ see note οιι S. ii. 2.

to have esteemed next to Caecuban, is here
called⁸ forte: and elsewhere⁸ severum 'and

‘'ardena (c.i.27.9; ii-11.19). Itwas

a very strong spirituoua wine, and required
long keeping to become mellow. Fon-syth
(Italy, p. 261) stupped at Santa Agata (a
modern town in the Falernus Ager) iu the
hope of getting some real Falerniang but he
found it very inferior to the Formian which
he had lately drank at Mola (Formiae).

27. morabitur] This may have been a
mediol word for custiveneae. Porcellini
doec not notice this use cf it. ⁸ Mitulus,’
the limpetds noticed as among the ⁸ viliores
conchae’ by Martial (iii. 60);

“ Ostrea tu sumis stagno saturata Lueriam
Sugitur inciso mitulus ore mihi.”

The Greeks called it τελλίνη οι· ξιφῦδριον.
The ‘’lapathus is mentioned above as a
purgative (Epod. ii. 57, n.) ‘Brevia'
which Porphyrion interprete⁸ short-lived} as

“breve 1ilium” (C. i. 36. 16). refers rather,
as Orelli says, to the siae of the plant.

30. Lubrica nascentes] That ahell-fish
vvere best at the time of the nevv moon,
appears to have been generally believed
among the ancients. Gellius, in a chapter
(xx. 8)= “de iis quae habere συμπάθειαν
videntur cum luna a nte ac sene-
scente,” mentions that while he was dining
with his friendAnnianus the poet, at his
country neat, there arrived a large supply of
oysters from Rome, which proved to be
poor shrivelled thin
counted for it by the fact that the moon was
then on the vane, quoting Lucilius:

Et ιῖιέοιίιῑὶῦἓᾱὶεέ ⁹

The same heaffirmsinrespecttocats’ eyes,
that they get lar-ger as the moon increases,
and smaller as she wanea. The ancient·

of the moon οιι var-icus objecta. in which
