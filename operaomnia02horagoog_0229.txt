HORATII FLAGGI

ARGUMENT.

‘riu now Ι have fought and won. Now Ι hang up my arms to Venus. Here, here hang
my 10101105, my 11015, and my bow. Ο thou queen of Cyprus and of Memphis, do but

once lay thy rod upon the proud Chloe.

V1x1 puellis nuper idoneus
Et militavi non sine gloria ;
Nunc arma defunctumque bello

Barbiton hic paries habebit,
Laevum marinae qui Veneris latus 5

Custodit.

Hic hic ponite lucida

Funalia et vectes et arcus
Oppositis foribus minaces,
Ο quae beatam diva tenes Cyprum et

Memphin carentem Sithonia nive,

Regina, sublimi flagello
Tange 0111οὸ0 semel arrogantem.

l. idonens] Orelli’ 5 interpretation, ‘when
1 was of an age to love,’ quita 011015 the
true meaning ,1 think. The words would
be suitable to 0 youthful lover under 1110
chagrin of 0 first disappointment. ovid
says love 15 0 wax-fare, “Militiae 5ρο0105
⁸amor 051, discedite segnes' '.(A A. ii. 233).

“Militat omnis amans et habet 5110 casin
Cupido” (Am. 1. 9. l). The 01105 11115
lover proposes to hang up in the temple of
Venus on the lest wall, as being most pro-
pitious (500 Cic. 1)1νί11.11.39. 82: “Nobis

meliora? '—butsee also next ode, v. 15, n.),

tress, the crowbar that broke open 1101 door,
and the bow and arrows which, 1 suppose, he
carried 05 emblems of his passion. The last
two words, ⁴ et arcus,' Bentley would change

into ⁸ securesque,' because we 11051· that
young takes carried 1101011015 to break down
111011 011511055οέ doors if n , bnt we
have no authority for 111011· carrying bom
and ari-owe, and probably they did not3 but
Horace makes his 11010 hangup 1115 bow, and
that is 011 we know about it. All the MSS.
agree, and the old commentator-s take no
notice of the word. Orelli quotes a gloss
in the MS. of Queen’ 5 0011030, Oxford, on
‘arcusz' “quibus janitores terrerent?

10. Memphin] Herodotus (ii. 112) speaks
of 0 temple at Memphis to Ξεὲνη Ἀφροδίτη,
110111 by Proteus on the occasion of Paris
and Helen being driven upon the coast of
Egypt, according to 0 10001 legend, which
