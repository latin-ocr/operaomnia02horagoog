Laudavere sales: nimium patienter utrumque
Ne dicam stulte mirati, simodo ego et vos
Scimus inurbanum lepido seponere dicto
Legitimumque sonum digitis callemus et aure.

*Ignotum tragicae genus invenisse Camenae

Dicitur et plaustris vexisse poemata. Thespis,
Quae canerent-agerentque peruncti faecibus ora.
Post hunc personae pallaeque repertor honestae
Aeschylus et modicis instravit pulpita tignis

Et docuit magnumque loqui nitique cothurn0.

275. Iynotum traficae] Plutarch, in
his life of Solon (c. 29), ssys thet when
Thespis was Just introducing bagedy und
drawing large andiences from the novelty of
the thing, which wss before the contests
had been established, Solon being then old
sud fond of smusement, ἐθεάσατο τὸν Θεσ-
πιν αὐτὸν ὑποκρινόμενον ὥσπερ ἔθος ἦν
τοῖς παλαιοῖς. His first representation
was nc. 535. The nume τραγ la be-
longed, as obser-ved above (on v. 0), ιο
the dithyrsrnbic songs of the Bscchic fes-
tivals, and these ure of uncertain origin,
bnt of great untiquity. The extent to which
Thespis can be considered the suthor οῖ
ingedy is thst he introduced sn actor in-
dependent of the chorus, who sustsined
various parts under the disguise of s linen
mssk. (See v. 192, n.) This account
therefore of the invention of tragedy at the
viat-ge, the faces smenred with lees of
wine, the waggon with which Thespis went
round Attica, and so forth, may be rejected,
says Meua, ‘⁶ since all these arise from a
confiision between the origin of comedy and
tragedy. Comedy orig-insted at the rnrsl
Dionysia οι· the vintsge festival. Aristo·
phsnes calls the comic of his own
time lee·singers (τρυγῳδοί), bnt he never
gives this neme to the tregic poets end
αιτιοι-ο. The waggon suits not the dithy-
rnmb, which was sung by a standing chorus,
bnt s processioa which occurred in the
earliest form of comedy. Moreover in
many festivals there wss s custom of throw-
ing out jests snd scurrilous sbuse from s
‘vruggon (σκώμματα ἐξ ἁμαξῶν). It is only
1η completely avoiding this error (which
rem on a very natural confusion) that it is
possible to reconcile the earliest history of
the dmm with the best testimonies, espe-
cially that of Aristotle” (p. 291).

278. Post bunc personae pallaeque] Ho-
race makes Aeschylus the inventor of the

mask and tragic dress described above (v. 215,
n.). But there cen be no doubt thet he who
first putansctorupon the stage,if he,us most
suppose, gave him various parts ιο sustnin,
must hsve employed mnsks suited to the
different characters. There wem symbolical
masks for different eges und classes, sud
there were descriptive musks for different
persons, representing peculiarities by which
they would be known. Gellius (v. 7) derives
the word from ⁴ per-sono,’ conceiving thst
they were contrived so as ιο assist the
voice. But that etymology will not do, if
it were only for the quantity of ‘ sono!
The derivation is unknown. “ Mmknss’
Miiller ssys, “ originsted in the taste sor
mumming and disguises of all sorts preva-
lent st the Bacchic festivals. They not
only concesled the individual features of
well-known αιτιοι-ο und enabled the spec·
tntors entirely to forget the performer in
his pert, but gave ιο his whole espect thet
ideal character which the tragedy of snti-
quity demanded.” Roscius first introduced
mssks on the Roman stage about A.u.c.
650. The garment Horace mesns'by ⁸ pslln'
hus been described before. It was called
ποικίλον or ἀνθινὸν from its rich em-
broidery. For the proper meaning of
‘palla' see S. i. 8. 23, n. As ιο ‘pulpita’
and ‘cothurnus’ see Epp. ii. l. 174, n.
Aeschylus msy hsve mede improvements in
whst is called among ns the property of s
thentre, but there is no resson to suppose
that he invented sny of the sbove things.
⁴ Magnum loqui ' is usually referred ιο the
style of Aeschylus, his ῥήματα γομφοπαγῆ
as Aristossinnes calls them. From the con-

nexion 1t seems rather ιο mesn thst he ·

taught the actor how ιο articulate loudly.
There is nothing about style here.

race tekes no account of the earliest form
