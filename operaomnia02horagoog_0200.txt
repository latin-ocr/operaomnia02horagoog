CARMINUM 111.13‚ 14. ’ 175

The ode is an address to a fountain, a common subject enough, and we need only sup-
pose that the name was suggested to Horace by the recollections of his childhood, without
imagining him really on the point of offen-ing sacrifice, or δοίης· m the neighbourhood of
his birth- place when he wrote. It has something of the nature of an epigramma or
inscription, and is among the choieest of Horaee' s small pianes.

Ο FoNs Bandusiae, splendidior vitro,

Te flagrantis atrox hora Caniculae

Fessis vomere tauris
Praebes et pecori vago.
Fies nobilium tu quoque fontium,
Me dicente cavis impositam ilicem
Saxis, unde loquaces 15
Lymphae desiliunt tuae.
