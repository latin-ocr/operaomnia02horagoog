Nil medium est. Sunt qui nolint tetigisse nisi illas
Quarum subsuta talos tegat instita veste;

Contra alius nullam nisi olenti in fornice stantem.

Quidam notus homo cum exiret fornice, “ Macte

Nam simul ac venas inflavit tetra libido

Huc juvenes aequum est descendere, non alienas

Cicero charges Verres with the name effe-
minacy: ‘⁸ Quum iste cum pallio purpureo
talarique tunica versaretur in conviviis
muliebribus, non offendebantur hominen ’'
(Act. ii. 1. 5, c. 12). A great deal has been
written upon the identification of Maecenas
with this n (whatever the name may
have been), and of Agrippa with the oppo-
nite character in the next verae. But either

mentioned by the elder Seneca in hia book

orator. That they were persone of some
note Orelli infera from the fact that Horace’a
ridicule of them had made him enemiea, as
appears from the passage quoted above from
the fourth satire. But it doea not appear
that in that plane Horace meana more than
to illustrate the inoffenaive character of hia
satirieal mitings, nor can Orelli’e inference 1

think be suetained. Rufillus is probably only
a diminutive of the common name Rufua,
invented for thie fop, though we meet with
the name Rufina in Tacitus (Anu. iii. 36).
