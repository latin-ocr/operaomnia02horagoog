discussion, 03 13 well known. Aster-

solution ol the difficulty first suggested,

But even with this unsuthorized correction
(which Orelli describes sufficiently when 110
seys⁸ ‘nemo recepit’ ’,) thet construction is
very hmh, 03 any body will see who tries
to construe the pessege upon this hypothe-
sis. But it is the one generally received
now, though⁸ evehit’ is retained. Mr. Tute

there could be no resson why the men who
