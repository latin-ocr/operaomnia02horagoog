48. Non isto vivimus illic] We may imagine
the indignation with which Horace listened
to the insolenoe of his compenion. He
represents himself throughout the scene ee
one wanting in the sels-possession necessu!
for dealing with euch e person, end here he
shows it again. Instead of passing by such
impertinence with contempt, οι· making it,
ee with more addi-ees he might have done,
en excuse for leaving the mun, he repliee to
him, end vehemently defende his pen-on
end himself. His adv ’s impertinence
only risen higher with thie, es might be
expected, end is not diminiehed by the ill-
timed irony in ‘ velis tantummodo ι quae tm
virtus, expugnabis: δια, au of which may
be supposed to be eeid in e etate of excite-
ment only calcinated to give the coxcomb

leave no means untried to secure not only
en acquaintance, but the nearest place in
Maeoenas’ regei-d (54). All thie brings out
the conti-est between the two characters
(the one e mere men of the world, of e low
sort, end the other ι well-bred but not very
enen-gotie genuam) with great force end
in ι very amusing wey. The German com-
mentatore ere a little too mutter of fect in
their view of the scene 1 think. -— For
‘vivimus ’ (v. 48) Bentley reads ⁸ vivimr’
on the authority of three inferior MSS..
und quoting C. ii. 16: “ vivitur parve bene.’'

59. deducam] “Haec enim ipen eunt
honorabilia quae videntur levin etque oom-
munia, solutari, appeti, decedi, murgi, de-
duci, reduci, consuli '⁹ (Cic. de Senect- c.
18). To attend upon a person when he
leaves home is ‘deducere ς’ ‘reducem' to
accompeny him on hie ntum. (ἔπειτ men,
