CARMEN sEcULARE.

Wmm Augu-tus had completed the period of ten year· for which the imperial power
metlintplacedinhiehanda (A.u.c. 727—737), he determined to celebrate hia anc-
ceeecaat home andabroadby an exn-sordium festival, and he took ae hie model the
Ludi Tarentini οι· Taurii, which had‘ ιιι former timeo been observed a a meane of propi-

vae probably convenient to have it believed that the pineo were no more than the
observence of a periodic'el solemnity. The Quindeeimiri were ordered to consult the
Sibyllino books, end they reported, ιιο doubt ae they vere desired, that the fitne m

Since Dis and Proserpina were the divinitiee chiefly invoked in the ancient gamee, the
question elisee, why were Apollo and Diana the leading deitiee on this occasion ἓ If it be
admimd that the festival vae obeerved ae a matter of convenience and not stom any
religione feeling, it ie not difficule to understood that the olden- precedente were only
generally adopted, end the deitiee most in fnehion were ae e matter of course mbafituted
for the obsoleto Dis and Proserpina. Augustus considered himself eepeclally under tho
pmtection of Apollo, and the attribute· assigned in the olden time to the infernal deifice,
aethe originatore and avertere of physice! evile, had bythie time been mesen-ed to
Apollo and hia nister ae representing the eun and moon, ae Mitacherlieh hae obser-ved.
Orelli on thie point quotes with approval nome remarks of Jahn οιι Vis-g. Ecl. iv. 10 to
this effect: thet a notion commonly existed among the Greeks, and aleo among the
Etruscam and Romane, that the universe wan moving in a cycle the completion of which
would measure one great year of the world3 that thie year was divided into 10 mentha
or agee (eaecnla), the length of which vna not defined but wne declared from time to
time, ae they were completed, by prodigies eent from heaven. This accounts for the irre-
gular celebration of the Secular- gamen at Rome. The Sibyllino books, he goe· on to
