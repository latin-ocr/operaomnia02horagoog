Et frugi castusque verecundusque coibat.
Postquam coepit agros extendere victor et urbes
Latior amplecti murus vinoque diurno

Placari Genius festis impune diebus,

Accessit numerisque modisque licentia major3
Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum
Rusticus urbano confusus, turpis honesto?

Sic priscae motumque et luxuriem addidit arti

Tibicen traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem3

Sic etiam fidibus voces crevere severis,

Et tulit eloquium insolitum facundia praecepa,
Utiliumque sagax rerum et divina futuri
Sortilegis non discrepuit sententia Delphis.

war if we suppose the Greeks to be meant.

‘ Liber laborum ' is a poeticsl construction
like ‘operum solutis ’¹ (C. iii. 17. 16) and
‘operum vacuo ” (S. 11 2. 119).

215. traxitque eaque per pulpita ver-
tam] The ‘pella' worn by tragic actore had
a train called ⁴ syrma,' from σύρειν, because
it swept the stage. This is what Horace
allude· to. The Roman dress was probably
not so splendid as the Greek, of which Miil-
ler observes that “it was a Bacchic festa!

wore long striped garments (χιτῶνες arodi,-
ρεις, uolui) reaching to the grournl, over
which were thrown upper gai-ments of pur-
ple or some other brilliant colour, with all
sorte of gay nimmings and gold ornaments
(ἱμάτια and χλαμύδες. See Epp. i. 6. 40,
ιι.). Even Hercules ap in this rich
and gaudy dress, to which his distinctive
attributes, the club and the bow, were

216. Sic etiam fidibus voces crevere
severia] 1 am not sufficiently acquainted
with music to explain the scales of the
tetrachord or the improvements made by
Terpander. (See above, v. 83, ιι.) But
the reader who understands the subject may
consult Miiller's chapter on Greek Music,
in his History of Greek Literature, c. xii.
The sedate and serious Doric style would
be expressed by ⁴ fidibus severis ς’ but Ho-
race is speaking generally, and probably
from his own imagination, when he says
that in the course of time the grave style of
music to which the choi-uses were once sung
gave way to a more vehement style, as the
eloquence of the chorus grew more im-
petuous, and it began to speak in language
obscure, prophetie, and oracular. There
is no historical in this account,
though in respect to the obscurity of some
of the Greek choi-uses Horace wrote from
what be knew of them.

Greeks. “The name of 'lh-agedy (goat's

resemblance in form between Satyrs and
goats could hardly have given a name to
