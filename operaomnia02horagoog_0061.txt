HORATII FLAOOI

CARMEN XIII.

The same remark applies to this ode as to many others, that those who believe it to
have reference to real persons, and the jealousy to be any thing but a poetical jealousy,
have mistakeu the character of Horaoe's writings. It would be difficult to imagine the
man who wrote these verses really jealous while he was writing them, or much acquainted·
with that passion. The ode is too slight sor us to judge whether it was taken from a
Greek origina13 but the expression in v. 16 shows that Greek ideas were running in the
writer¹s head, which may be said, 1 feel safisfied, of almost every one of his amatory com-

positione.

ARGUMENT.

Lydia, while thou art praising Telephus' neck, Telephus' arms, ohl my heart-is ready to
burst. My mind tosses about, my colom· comes and goes3 and the tear stealing down
my cheek tells of the slow fire that burns within. It galla me when his rough hands
hurt thy shoulders, or his teeth leave their mark on thy lips: think not he will be
constant who could hurt that nectared mouth. How happy they whom love binds fast

to the day of their death!

CUM tu, Lydia, Telephi
Cervicem roseam, cerea Telephi

Laudas brachia vae meum
Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur.

Tum nec mens mihi nec offlor 5
Certa sede manet, humor et in genas

Furtim labitur, arguens

Quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus.
¹‘Uror, seu tibi candidos Ρ

Turparunt humeros immodicae mero

20

Rixae sive puer furens

Impressit memorem dente labris notam.
Non, si me satis audis-e,

Speres perpetuum dulcia barbare

2. cerea Telephi] For ⁴ cerea,' Bentley
ou the authority of Flavius Caper, one of
the older grammarians who'· misquotes this
passage, substitutas ‘ lactea' for ‘cerem'
He is very well ansvered by Cunningham.
That reading however shows the sense in
which Caper quoting from memory under-
stood ‘ cerea,' ‘ white as wax,' not as many
take it, ⁴ soft,' ‘ pliant,' διο.

6. manet,] The MSS. vary between
ο this and ⁶ manent! Ven.. 1483, has ‘ ma·
net! So also has the oldest Berne MS. of
Orelli, and many others. Cruquius’ Blan-
dinian MSS. had all ⁸ manent! There is
more probability of ‘ manent’ having been
substituted on account of the metre for
⁶ manet,' thau ⁴ mauet’ for ‘ manent 3⁹ but

the lengtheuing of a short syllable in such
positione is not uncommon. So ii. 13. 16:

‘⁸ Caeca timet aliunde faml' Bentley lays
down the rule, and Zumpt approves it, that
two substantives in the singular number
coupled by ⁴ nec' and ⁶ nec' have the verb
in the singular, which he says usage and rea-
son demand. 1 do not see the reason in the
case of disjunctive any more than of con—
junctive particles, and to assume the usage
is to beg the question. But that the singular
verb is admissible no one will deny, and 1
thmS admitted it ou the authority of good

13. Non. — Sper-es] This more empha-
tic negative (Key's L. G. 1402) is used
not uncommonly in prohibitive sentences,
