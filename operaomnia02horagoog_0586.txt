Gur ita crediderim nisi quid te detinet audi. 5
Fabula qua Paridis propter narratur amorem

Graecia Barbariae lento collisa duello

Stultorum regum etpopulorum continet aestus.

Antenor censet belli praecidere causam:

Quid Paris?
Cogi posse negat.

Ut salvus regnet vivatque beatus
Nestor componere lites

10

Inter Peliden festinat et inter Atriden;
Hunc amor, ira quidem communiter urit utrumque.
Quidquid delirant reges plectuntur Achivi.

Seditione‚ dolis, scelere atque libidine et ira

15

Iliacos intra muros peccatur et extra.
Rursus quid virtus et quid sapientia possit
Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulixen,

Qui domitor Trojae multorum providus urbes

Et mores hominum inspexit, latumque per aequor,

Dum sibi dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa
Pertulit adversis rerum immersabilis undis.

commendation of a short treatise of his,
⁶ de Luctu.' The earliest editions have
‘planius ac melius ς’ and Acron, in his
commentary, has ⁸ manifestius et melius ς’
Porphyrion ⁶ melius et aptius,’ which 1 take
to be ‘apertius’ lf so, both these Scho-
liasts confirm the reading ⁶ planius! The
Blandinian MSS. had ⁶ plenius ς’ so have
most of the Parisian, but the oldest of all
has ⁶ planius,' and three others. The
St. Gallen and Berne have the latter, and
five os Fea’s Vaticaus3 with many others
quoted by Lambinus, Torrentius, Cruquius,
and Bentley, who restored ⁶ planius ' aster
it had been banished more than a century.
1 find ⁶ plenius ' in the Venetian edition of
1549. 1 think ⁴ planius ' suits the context
better. Chrysippus is said by Πίος. Laert.
(vii. 180) to have written more thau 700
volumen: so that ⁴ plenius ’ would be rather
out of place, though Obbarius, who retains
it, supposes Horace to mean that there was
more instruction in Homer than in all the
volumes of Chrysippus put together-3 but
he also means it is more clearly conveyed.
(See Introduction.)
¹ 7. Bar-bariae] That is, Phrygia. (See
Epod. ix. 6.) ‘ Aestus ’ is a metaphor from
the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and
represents the passione and variableness

of the princes and people.

9. Antenor emet] At a meeting of the
TroJ‘an chiefs alter the combat of Hector
and Ajax, Antenor proposes to restore
Helen to th'e Greeks, which Paris fiatly
refuses, ἀντικρὺ δ’ ἀπόφημι γυναῖκα μὲν
οὐκ ἀποδώσω (ΙΙ. vii. 362, sqq.).

seems to belong to ‘ Atriden! The allusion
is to Nestor¹s attempt to mediate between

19. {limitor- rl’rojaexe] The epithet πτολί-
πορθος is frequently applied to Ulysses by
Homer. Cicero accounts for it in a letter
to Plancus (x. 13), in which he urges him
to follow up the victory of Brutus at Mutina,
and to crush M. Antonius: “Qui enim
M. Antonium oppresserit is bellum con-
fecerit. Itaque Homerus non Ajacem uec
Achillem (which is an oversight) sed Ulixem
appellavit troiia-opens? The three first
verses of the Odyssey are almost translated
in these lines. ⁶ immersabilis' is like
α’βὰπτιστος in Pindar (Pyth. ii. 80)
ἀβάπτιστός εἰμι, φελλὸς ὣς ὑπὲρ ἕρκος,
ἅλμας. Compare C. iv. 4. 65: ‘⁸ Merces
profundo pulchrior evenit.”
