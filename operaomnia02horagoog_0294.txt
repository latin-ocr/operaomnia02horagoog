GARMEN 1.
A.U.C. 723.

Wnnn Augustus had determined on the expedition against M. Antonius and Cleopatra

which led to the battle of Actium, Α.σ.ο. 723, he summoned, as we lem-n from Dion Cas-
sius (50. 11), the leading senators and men of Equestrian rank to meet him at Brundu-
sium, for the benefit of their counsel and (the historian says) to keep the Equestrians stom
mischicf, and also to show the world the harmony to which he had brought men of all
orders at Rome. whatever the motivas may have been, the fact may be accepted.
Maecenas obeyed this summoue and went to Brundusium, but was sent back by Augustus
to watch ovet· the peace of the city and the affairs of Italy, with what particular powers,
or under whnt title, history does not inform us, nor is the question material here. The
Scholiasta (Acron and Comm. eruq.) state that Maecenas had had the commmd of the
fleecor partofit, as tribune, given him byAugustus. But there is no aedit vobo
naached to such statements, which are osten taken (as this may be), like the inscriptions.
invented by grammarians, from incidental names and allusione in the odes themselves.
He appears to have accompanied the expedition to Sicily against Sextus Pompeius Anno.
718, and, on referring to the article ‘Maecenas’ in Smith's Dict. Biog., it will be seen
thnt the writer is of opinion this Epode was written on that ocoesion. This opinion is
quite new, and 1 believe the general opinion to be correct. The lnngunge of affection in
this Epode is too strong for the short acquaintance Horace had then enjoyed with
Maecenas ς also, there is evidence of the Sabine farm having come into Horace's posses-
sion when he wrote it (v. 31). But that this did not occur till aster thepublicstion of the
first book of Satires is certain, and it is generally referred to A.u.c. 72⁰- The opinion
of the same writer that Horace actually accompunied Maecenas on this expedition to Sicily
is nolioed elsewhere (C. iii. 4. 26, ιι.). It is very possible that Maecenas may have had
the offer of a command on the expedition against M. Antonius, and that both he and
Horace believed he ms going οιι that service, until on his arrival at Brundusium Augustus
thought fit to send him back to discharge more importent duties at Rome. Horace,
supposing him to be going on this expedition, wished to accompany him, but Maecenas
would not allow it (v. 7), which gave occasion for this Epode.
