as in Epp. (ii. 1. 56), “Aufert Pacuvius
docti famam senis Accius alti· ” and above

⁴Romano agro, ’as Orelli suggests, though ιιι
respect to the provinces and inferior states
of Italy that form of expression is used, as
in the yexamples he quotes from Cicero' s
orations against Verres. The colony of
Venusia was formed in Α. ιι. c. 463, the
last year of the third Samnite Ψυ,π11ὀιι L.
Postumius Megellus and C. J umus Brutus
Bubulcus were consuls (see Clinton, F. H..)
The town, which was on the box-ders of
Lucania aiud Apulia, belonged ιο the Sam-
nites, from whom it was taken by Q. Fabius.
(Sabelli was the name given by the Romans
to all the tribes which issued from the
Sabine stock, of whom the Samnites were
one. See Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. i. 91.)
Apulia and Lucania were, at the beginning
of this war, independent states in close
alliance with the Samnites; but after the
first year they found it for their interest to
desert those allies and joined the Romans,
with whom they continued to unite their
forces till the end of the war. Horace’s
supposition that one οι· other of those states
was meditan'ng or carrying on war with
Rome is not therefore strictly accurate3 but
they were always very doubtful allies, and
were glad to assint their old enemies the
Greek cities in their resistance to Rome
when they called in the help of Pyrrhus3
and it was not till the fall of Tarentum,
Α. ιι. c. 482, that these, in common with the
other southern states of Italy, finally ac-

knowledged the supremacy of Rome. and cry,

accepted their freedom from her. It was
in consequence of the commanding position
of Venusia, in reference to the three nations

of the Samnites, Apuliam, and Lamniana,
that the Romans sent there 111 the above

the war with Pyrrhus. (See Niebuhr’ s
Lectures, p. 508. Schmitz.) After their
reverse at the battle of Heraclea, mmo.
474, the remnant of their arm retr-ested to
Venusia, and here many found refuge after
the defeat of Cannam Tbere are very few
monuments of antiquity or ruins left at
Venosa. A marble bust placed upon a
column professes to be an ancient bust of
Horace· but its authenticity ιο more than
doubtful. Swinburne take-s it to be the head
of a saint, but observes that the inhabitants
have not canonized Horace as the Neapolitana
have Virgil. Horace commences this digres-

sion meaning to speak humbly of himself
as compared with Lucilius, a Roman⁴ equesss

and continues it perhaps from affection for
his native place, and ιο show that it had done
good service and was not to be despised.

The quantity of the second syllable in
Venusinus Horace makes short yhere, and
in C. i. 28. 26. Juvenal lengthens it
(vi. 167) ⁴Malo Venusinam quam te, Cor-

nelia, mater Gracchorum? where, as here,

the humble inhabitant of Venusia is con-

trasted with the proud mata-on of Rome.

⁴Quo ne ⁹ (v. 37) is an unusual expression,
in which ⁴ quo ' is redundant.

39. Sed laic stilus haud petet ultro]
On this use of ‘sed’ see C. iv. 4. 22, ιι.
⁴ Ultro ' means here wantonly, without pro-
vocation or cause. (See C. iv. 4. 51, ιι.)
Τ11ο MSS. vary as usual between ⁴ destrin-
gere' and ‘distringere.’ See C. iii. 1.
17, ιι. Orelli prefers ⁴ destringere,’ Hein-
dorf⁴ distringere! Having adop ted the
latter form in the above passage, p1 do so
here, without feeling quite certain which‘ is
right. The same variation occurs in the
MSS. in Caesar (B. G. 1. 25). ‘Ut pereat'
is an imitation of the Greek use of ὡς, ex-
pressing a wish. From ⁴ at ille ¹ the con-
struction is alittle irregular, but the abrupt-
ness of the several clauses is well suited to
the occasion: ⁴ but for that man that pro-
vokes me, be had better not touch me, 1
he' ll suffer if he does,’ &c- It spoils
the sentence to put⁴ melius—clamo’ in a
parenthesis, as Bentley does, so that‘ ini'
may govern ‘flebit'
