The Greeks had a proverb to the some effect,
explained by tho Schol. on Aristoph. Av.
507. “ The verse in Virgil, ⁴ Hinc alta sub
rupe canet frondator ad auras ’ (Ec. i. 57),
naturally occurs, when in our walks under
the rocky cliffs of Posilipo we see the
peasant swinging from the top of a tree on
a rope of twisted willows, trimming the
poplar and the luxuriant tendrils of the
vine, and hear him make the whole vale
ring with his rustic ditty. A classic scholar
cannot stroll under the groves of the plain
without calling to mind Horaoe' a ‘durus
vindemiatorss &c., if he attend to the vine-
dresser sitting among the boughs lashing

rough jokes that gave such zest of old to the
fumes of Atella ” (Swinburne‚ vol. i. p. 116).
In ⁴ vindemiator' the third syllable ooa-
leooes with the fourth. See C. iii. 4. 41,
and add S. ii. 3. 2452 “Luscinias soliti
impenso prandere ooemptaa.” i. 8. 43:
“ Imagine cerea Largior arserit ignis. ”
i. 2. 21: “Neque ostrea Nec scarus aut
poterit‚” διο.

uenum,’ ‘ sal,’ ‘ acetum,' are all words well
ehosen for describiug the poisonous charne-
ter of these men's malioe. Plautus uses the
last of these words two or three timos.

would have spoilt the Greek’s johe, and lost
him his cause perhaps, ludit then been sup-
posed, as some have in these days supposed,
he alluded in ‘ reges ’ to the death of Caesar.
It was not a subject for a jest, though
Brutus might stin believe he had done the
state a service by the part he took in that
murder. The man must be supposed to
allude to him whom Brutus claimed for his
ancestor, L. Junius Brutus, who helped to
expel tho last of the king-⁸. The plural
⁸ reges ' does not stand in the way of this
explanation. Rupilius is brought into com·
parison with Tarquinius in the first line of
the Satire ‘⁸ Proscripti Regis,” &c-
