like minute points except as it helps us ιο truce the progress of Horece's mind and style,
which it is plain went through s great change after the publioetion of the three first books
of the odes. Ι very much doubt whether he could have copied himself so exactly as hc
has done in these two odes if any great interval had elapsed between them. 1 therefore
am inclined to set down this among Horace's earlier odes which he brought ont of his
desk for the purpose above mentioned. But others will have their own opinion, and 1
am not wedded to mine. lt will at any rste be observed that the introduction of Tor-
quatus’ name or the omission of it would be equally immaterial ιο the character and
scope of the ode, end that what has been said of other odes, and among them that above
referred to, is equally applicabis to this, mmcdx, that the name of a friend is only inu-o·
duced to give life and individuality ιο the poem.

ARGUMENT.

The winter is gone and the spring is returning with its green leaves, its gentler streame,
and its Graces. The seasons change and remind us of our end: hut the revolving year
repaire its Iessos, while we go ιο the dust for ever, and we know not when it will be.
What thou dost enjoy thyself is so much taken from thy greedy heir. When thou art
dead, Torqustus, thy family, thine eloquence, and thy piety will not restore thee to
life any more than the love of Diana could bring beck Hippolytus οι· the friendship os
Theseus Peirithous.
