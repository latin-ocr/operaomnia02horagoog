406 HORATII FLAOOI

SATIRE VII.

Ι do not think many persons will agree with Franks iu his high estimato of this
Satire, the best of its kind, he says, and yielding to none or even preferable to all
others, in elegance of composition, suavity of diction, and dramatic power. He wishes
to prove that it was not the earliest of the Satires, as most commentatore suppose, wme
judging from the quality, others with more reason from the subject of it. The subject
is a dispute, travestied 1 think without much humour, between one of the officere on
Brutus' staff and a merchant of Clazomenae (a town on the gulf of Smyrna), arising it
may be supposed out of some money transactione. Horace treats the matter much in
the same way as the dispute got up between the two parasites for the amusement of
Maecenas and his friends at Caudium (S. 5. 51, sqq.). He no doubt had some reason
for disliking Rupilius, which the Scholiasta supply, whether with any sufficient authority
it is impossible to say. They tell us that this man’s native place was Praeneste (which
may be gathered from v. 28); that he was banished from that town by his follow-citizens,
that he then served in Africa in the army of Attius Varus, propraetor of Cn. Pompeium
that he was received into favour by Julius Caesar aud made Praetor; that aster Caesar-’s
death he was proscribed by the triumvirs and joined the army of Brutus. Finally, that
he was disgusted at Horace, a man of low birth, being made a military tribune, and con·
tinually insulted him, which indignities Horace retorted in this Satire. Persius, the Scho-
liasta say, was born of a Greek father and a Roman mother. Beyond this, which may or
may not be true, we know nothing about him but what we guther from this Satine, that
he was a wealthy man and carried on a large business of some kind at clazomenae.
Dillenbr. supposes he was employed as contractor for the supply of corn in Brutus' army,
and that his disputo with Rupilius arose out of transactione connected with this business,
ou which, from his experience, he was employed by Persius3 for Dillenb. and others (see
Spohn in Jahn’s edition of Horace, ed. 2nd, p. 257) identify the hero of this Satira with
P. Rupilius Muneuia, the Roman ⁸ eques' and ‘ publicanus‚' recommended by Cicero to
Crassipes the Quaestor of Bithynia (Ad Fam. xiii. 9). These theories are hardly worth
mentioning in a case of so much obsmirity. Comm. Cruq. says Persius was a ‘ negotiator ' at
Clazomenae. But the ⁴ negotiatores' (money-lenden) in Asia and the other provinca were
not natives (as Persius seems to have been), but Roman ‘ equites! They were an important
class, who gave no little trouble to the governors (see Cic. ad Qu. Fr. 1. i. ep. l, c. l),
and their commercial mna-ctione in Asia particularly were ou a large scale. The disputa
arose when Brutus and his army were in Asia Minor, which was in nanc. 7 11—712 (see
note on v. 18). How soon afterwards the Satire was written it is impossible to say ς not
long, 1 think. It may have been made on the spot, and shown to those who would find
most ⁸m¹¹⁸0men¹² in ἢ, in the camp. Ι think this is more likely than that Horace should
have reverted to such a subject aster his arrival at Rome, where the soene must have been
unknown or little knowu3 when those who might have enjoyed the joka were most of
them dead or in exile, and his own feeling against Rupilius must have been forgotten in
the soenes that he had since gone through. The poem is a mere fragment in the dramatic
style so admirably sustained in the ninth satire; but in this there isno character brought
0¹¹2, n0¹¹0 of the happy touches and traits of nature which there are found in every line.
Certainly no two poems could bear less evidence of being the work of the same mind,
and this may be taken as some indication of the early composition of the present oue;
but 1 rest more on the circumstance that the point of the story would have been lost in a
great measure any length of time aster the event it refers to. Perhaps we may infer from
the abruptness of the conclusion that Horace intended when he began ·to make a longer
poem, but found his materials or his time or his spirit fail.
