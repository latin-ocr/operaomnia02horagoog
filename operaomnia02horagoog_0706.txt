EPISTOLARUM ΙΙ. 2. 681

love, wine, end φοι-ι, and now it is taking poetry too. Besides people's testes differ
so much. Yon like song, another likes iambics, e third course satire. How eun Ι
plense you all? Then again how cen 1 write among all the dista-actions of the town?
Here amnne-lle metobehisbaih ther-eto quit my business and listento his books3
one man is sick on the Quirinal, another et the extremity of the Aventino, end 1 must
see them both, e pretty good distance you must allow. ⁴ Ohl but the streets ure so
broad end clear you cun think as you go along-⁹ Why there is every sort of obsti-action,
contractors with their mules and porters, mnes swinging stone· end benms over
your head, funereis, mad dogz, filthy swine3 1 should like γοα ιο make verses in such
ι scene ss that. The poet loves retirement end the woodsg the student who has
been for γεω-ε porIng over his books is rather awkwerd in the world5 how cun 1 write
verses while the wsves end storms of the city are roering about me ?

(y. 87.) Resides, these poete do nothing but praise one mother. ⁶ A wonderful work Ξ
surelyall the Muses had e hand in itl' How we hold up our hemis and strut past
the libra-y which is one day ιο have s copy of our worksl We contest it like two
gladiatore, md Ι come off an Alcaeus in his judgment, end he s. Callimachus, nay s
Mimnermus if he likes, in mine. 1 could beer s good deal when Ι was oenvsssing for
applausu but now that 1 have retired Ι shut my ears to them ull.

(v. 1⁰6.) Though the public may lsugh st bsd verses, their authors are well satisfied. and
if γοα do not pruise them they will prsise themselves. But he who wants ιο write ο
real poem, must act his own censor and cut out what is bad, even if he keeps it still
locked up et home. He will not fail to reproduce obsolete δαι expressive words es
well as new3 he will pour along like a rapid river, and enrich the land with the copious
stream of his eloquenee3 pruning, smoothing, erasing, the mult will seem ee easy es
oport, like the mimo who twists his limbs in the clance.

(v. 126.) 1 had rather, says one, be 100k0d fipon aa a f001, and he satisfied with my own
persormsnoes, then be ever so learned and tormented to boot. He is like the gentleman
ιι Argos, who used ιο fancy himself sitting in the theatre and clapping the performers.
He was perfectly sane in other respects, and when his friends recovered him from this
munis, he bitterly complained that they hed taken away his pleasant illusion.

(v. 14⁰.) But, aster all, the best thing is ,ιο put away child's play and poetry, and take to
philosophy. Therefore 1 reason with myself thus ε ⁸ If you had ιι sever in your veins
γοα would spesi: ιο the physicinn. But if the more you have the more γοα παι, will
you keep that ιο yourself? If γοα found ι particular remedy did γοα no good, γοα
would avoid that remedy. Well, γοα heard men say that is a men had money he had
wisdom ε δαι if γοα find yourself no wiser now you are richer, will you stick ιο those
advisers? If weelth could make a man wise and good, you would be ashamed if any
were richer than yourselr. 1f whn‘t a man pays for is his own, and there are some
things which become oure by possession, then your neighbour's farm which supplies you
with nn γοα want is yours. What does it matter whether you paid for it yesterday or
longego? If a mun buys land, all he gete from itis bought, though he calls itsll his
own, and puts up boundaries to mark it off, ns if that could be one's own which may
change hands in e moment. What is the use of villas end barns if heir succeeds
heir es wsve succeeds πονο.) what are broad pastui-ee ιο us if death lays all low
alike? As for jewels and all fine things, there ere some who have them not, but the
wise mn ceres not to have them. Why one man prefers his ense to the riche· of
Herod, while his brother is sleving all day, their genius alone can tell, the companion
of their birth, their life, and their death, never the same, now fair, now dsrk. 1 shall
use my small means es 1 plesse, without sear os what my heir may say3 yet Ι am not
dispoeed to forget the difference between a cheerful liver und a profligate, a frugnl man
and s miser. It isone thing to squander, another to spend it libet-any, ιο seek no more
than γοα want, end to enioy like the school-boys the short holidsy thet is left γοα. ,
