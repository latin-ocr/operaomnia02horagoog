OARMINUM III. 6. 159

Paene occupatam seditionibus
Delevit Urbem Dacus et Aethiope,
Hic classe formidatae, ille 15
Missilibus melior sagittis.
Fecunda culpae secula nuptias
Primum inquinavere et genus et domos;
Hoc fonte derivata clades
In patriam populumque fluxit. 20
Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos
Matura virgo et fingitur artibus ;

so certain. The principal persen of that
name recorded in was a Parthian
noble whossedfrom Phraatesto M. Antonius,
and, though he returned to the king, we do
not hear that he fought against the Ro-
mans. It is therefore conjectured that
Monaeses here means Surenas, which is
not impossible, either through Horace' s in-

difference, or because Monaeses being a
common Parthian name Surenas may have
been socalled, Surenasbeing atitle, as
Zosimus says. (Many MSS. and all Orel-
li⁹s best have Mounesis.) Ean-6 (p. 269,
sqq.) discusses what he considers the his·

toricaldifficultiea of the passage, and con-

eludes by banishing the stanza altogether.

“Stropha haec quae nimium diu interpretes
decepit exulabit me judice ex carmine Hora·
tiano-⁹⁹ PeerlkampJ had the same
sentence on it besem Horace plainly al-
lndes, perhaps without strict acmuacy, to
the defeat, first of Crassus, and then of
Μ. Antonius, who was twice defeated, first
through his legate Decidius Saxa ιιι 714 by
Pacorus, and four years later when he com-
manded in person
Pacorus was dead. The Scholiests all say
the defeats alluded to were those of Crassus
ands-xmwhoeename appears, aswe now
have their text, under the disguise of De-
cius Sextus, except in Cruquius’ Scliolisst¹
who gives the name correctly, all but one
syllable, Didius for Decidius. ‘Non auspi-
catos’ is the usual way of acconnting for
defeat, by laying it to the neglect of the
auspices. Bentley, not liking‘ uostms non

12. renidet. ] Forcelliui explains this
word by ’ gaudere,' ’ laetari) The word is
not uncommonly used for smiling, and as
it seems to be only another form ot· ’ niteo,'

, at which time however

the lighting up of the face through plea-
sure, is the origin perhaps of this derived
sense.

14. Dacus et Aethiope,] These were
auxiliarios in Antonius⁹ army at Actium,
Aethiops standin for Egyptian. See Introd-

20. In 'pat ' epulumque] Bentley,
in one of the lo t of his notes, proposes

‘inque palzes' for ⁴ in patriam.⁹ But the
:fords as they stand are those of a common
ormula.

21. Motus doceri pandet Ionicos] The
Ionian was a volup tuous sort of danea with
which the Siciliane ιιι particular were fami-
liar, using it at thesestivals of Diana. τὸ δὲ
Ιωνικὸν Ἀρτέμιδι ὠρχοῦντο Σικελιῶται
μάλιστα (Pollux, quoted by Turnebus
Λᾶν. iv. 21). In the following line the
MSS. vary between ’ fingitur artibus,⁹ ⁸ fin-
gitur artubus,⁹ and ⁴ frangitur artubus-⁹ The
first reading is (among others quoted by
Lambinus and Cruquius and Bentley) that
of Orelli's oldest Ber-ne and Ziirich MSS.
It is that of the Venetian copy of landinus
(1483), (except that ’ fingitur ⁹ is by a mis-
print ⁸ figiturss) and Lambinus, Bentley, and
most modern editors have adopted it. ‘Arti-
bus' must bc every old reading, for Porphy-
rion, who with the other Scholiasta preferred

artubus: gives a note to cantion readers
against‘ artibus! “Artubus legendum· quia
non venit a nominatim* artes sed artus?
Nevertheless it has ⁶ n pointed out by
Lambinus, that ’ fingi “ ⁴ artubus' for ’ fin-
gitur artus⁹ is a very ,usual and hardly
admissible construction. ‘ Frangitur artu·
bns' is open to the same objection. The
true reading, 1 believe, lies between ’ fin-
y'tur artibus ⁹ and ‘ frangitur artibus! The
latter has no authority, and 1 am not there-
fore disposed to adopt it on my own, but
the expression is a legitimate one, and the
word ’ frangitur ⁹ comes nearer to the Greek
