Orelli aptly quotes a passage of Plutarch,
from which it would seem as if this anti·
thesis were in a measure proverbial (Com-
paratio Aristophanis et Menandri, i. 6) :—
ὥσπερ ἀπό κλήρου ἀπονέμει τοῖς προσ-

116⁶.) matrona pgtem] This epithet seems
to have the same meaning as its kindred
word πότνια, so common in Homer and
the Tragediaus. 'rho officious nurse has
always been a favourite character on the
stage. We find it in Aeschylus (Choephorae),
in Sophocles (Trachiniae), and Euripides
(Hippolytus). We are all sufficiently fami-
liar with it in Shakspeare’s Romeo and
Juliet. In Euripides' play and Shakspearc’s
they bear in one respect much the same
character. An ἔμπορος (⁶ mercator ⁹ is in-
troduced in the Philoctetes of Sop ocles,
and the prologus of the Electra (Euripides)
is spoken by an αὐτουργὸς (‘ cultor agelli ').
The Colchian may be put perhaps for any
of the barbarous tribes on the shores of the
Euxine, and the Assyrian for any of the
Eastern nations. See C. i. 2. 21, n., and
C. ii. 11. 16, n.) he opposition between
Thebes and Argos has reference partly per.
haps to Aeschylus' play, Sept. c. Thebas,
in which Polynices comes with an Argive
army to get possession of the crown of
Thebes, or to the Supplices of Euripides,
which turns on the burial of the seven lead-
ers who formed that expedition. But Ho-
race may have had in mind many other

Ph'l? of which the scene lay either at Argos
or hebes, in connexion with Oedipus, the
qum-el of his sona, the expedition of the
Epigoni, &c-

12⁰. Scriptor- honoratum ei sorte re-

‘Deus’ and ‘heros' are ponis] ‘Honoratus’ (for which Bentley

on his own conjecture substitutes ¹ Home-
reum' in one of his very long notes,—
“ meris argutiis,” says Fea) is only an epi-
theton ornans, conesponding to Homer-’s
πλυτ-ὅς, διο. ⁴ Reponis ’ means ‘ put upon
the stage again! The word is used in a
different sense v. 190: “ Fabula quse posci
vult et spectata reponi.”

122. nihil non arv-offe! amia] ⁸ Lot him
claim every thing for arms,' that is, let him
make arms his one appeal.

123. flebilis Ino,] There are several
fragments remaining of a play by Euripides
bearing the name of Ino, the daughter of
Cadmus. and wife of Athamas, who threw
herself into the sea with her son Melicerta,
and went through various sorrnws through
the wrath of Here. and the rivalry of her
husband’s other wives, Nephele and The-
misto. She was worshipped aster her death
as Leucothea, or Matuta Mater.

124. Perfidus Ixion, Ιο caym] Aeschylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides, each wrote a tra-
gedy entitled ⁴ Ixion,' of which fragments
remain- He was king of the Lapithae.
Having treacherously murder-ed his father-
in-law‚ Deioneus, he returned the goodness
of Zeus, who purified him, by trying to
sednce Here, for which he received hiswell-
known punishmfflt‚ and is rightly mlled
⁸ perfidus! The wanden-iuga of Io, the
daughter of Inachus, king of Argos, in the
form of a cow, whose passage sauss the
strait that separates the Propontis from
the Euxine gave it the name of Bosporus,
are related in many ways. The most re-
markable passage on this subject is con-
tained in the Prometheus of Aeschylus, in a
scene in which she is herself iun-oduoed.
