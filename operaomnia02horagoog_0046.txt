in other good authors. It is a stronger form
of ‘ mirei-,⁹ which is a common effect of ⁴ e '
and ⁸ de' in composition, as among many
other instances, ‘decertantem ' in the third
ode. ⁴ Demiror ’ is a word used by Cicero and
others, and adopted here by some editors3
hut there is nothing to object to in ⁸ cmii-s-
bitur,' which is the reading of all the MSS.
Bentley conjectures ‘ ut mirabitur ς’ but he
dooe not insert itin the text, nor does any
one else.—‘ Insolens ' is either used abso-
lutely or with a genitive (see Forcell.).

9. aurea .·] ‘ ΑΗ gold ' is Milton's trans-
lation, and none other that 1 know of will
do. The render’s own tact must fill up the
idea, which is a complex one. It is not
merely ‘⁸ illa meis oculis aurea semper erit,”
as Ovid says, nor only “auro contra cara
est,'' as Plautus. It implies perfectiori, just
as ⁶ aurea mediocritas ' signifies that perfect
state which transgresses neither to the right
nor to the left.

1⁰. vacuam,] ‘⁶ Elige de vacuis quam
non sibi vindicet slter,'' Ov. Herod. xx. 149.

temple of Neptune or other sea-god a pic-
ture representing their wreck and the clothes

among many others by virg-il, Aen. xii. 7 68 ε

“ Servati ex undis ubi figere dona solebant
Laurenti divo, et votas suspendere vestes?

The temples of Isis in particular were thus
adorned, aster the introduction of her wor-
ship into Rome, which was not till quite
the latter years of the Republic. She was
worshipped in Greece as Πελαγίαν, and the
Romans placed themselves under her pro-
tection at sea. 'fibullus says to her (i. 3.

27) :—

⁴⁶ Nunc, dea, nunc succurre mihi3 nam

posse mederi
Picta docet templis multa tabella tuis.”

And Juvenal asks (S. xii. 28)= ‘⁴ Pictores
quis nescit ab Iside pasci ?”

15. potenti-marie] Milton translates
‘⁴ the stern god of sea‚” not observing that
‘potens’ governs ⁶ maris ' as ‘⁴ potens
Cypri,” C. i. 3. 1.

CARMEN VI.

Aue. 725 (ἓ).

Notwithstsnding Agiippa's close connexion with Augustus, it is very probabis that
between that stem man and Horace there was but little sympathy or intercourse, and
without personal affection his muse did not rise to its highest ssights in the way of per-
sonal eulog-y. And during the time that he was writing the odes which compone the
three first books, judging by their character we may believe that he really felt unequal or
indisposed for singing the praises of a military hero, and that he considered such subJects
unsuited to him. Twice he checks himself when he gete upon heroic themes (C. ii. 1.
373 iii. 3. 69), but not till he has shown how competent he was, had he pleased‚ to have
handletl them, as he showed when he resumed this style of composition in later years, and
wrote that noble ode in praise of Drusus (iv. 4).
