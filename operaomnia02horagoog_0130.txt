he did not know or care whether it was ι
mountain or a river. However this may be,
there can be no doubt Niphates was a moun-
tain-range east of the ‘figi-is. The name
means the snow-mountain. Perhaps a part
os it may have been covered with perpetual
snow. Strabo (p. 529, Ed. Cas.) makes the
Tigris rise in the Niphates. This fact may
account for the confusion that existed be-
tween mountain and river. le successes of
Augustus in Armeniawerein Α. u. c. 734, and
the geographical question therefore is chsefl y
of interest here in a chronological point of
view· but even that interest vanishes, if we
suppose Horace to be speaking of conquesta
to come, as he does* m C.' ι. 12. 53, sqq. We
may then admit that Horace wrote of the
conquest of Armenia even five years before
any successes were gained there.

or it may be Horace meant the Tigris. See
last note. There was a river Medus which

flowed into the Araxes, near Persepolis, but
it was a small stream, and probably unknown
to Horace. He canndt allude to this, as some
suppose. Lambinus, however, thinks he
means this river, and says the expression is
that we meet with elsewhere. ⁴-Metau

22. verticem] Heinsius on Aen. i. 117,
states that the Medicean MS. always has
the reading ‘ vertex‚' not ¹ vortex! The
MSS. and editions vary in this passage, and
Porcellini says that ‘ vertex ' and ⁵ vortex ⁹
are written indiscriminately in the MSS. of
all the Latin authors. Fea adopts ‘ vertices:
but with it Charisius' absurd etymology,
“vertex a vertendo dicitur: vortex a vo·
The passage from Quintilian,
quoted by Forcell., shows how ⁴ vertex ’
passed into its derived meanings.

23. Gelono-v] This was one of the tribes
on the north bank of the Danube. See note
on 21, and C. i. 19. 10, n. About the same
time, it is supposed, with Augustus’ expedi-
tion against the Cantabri, Lentulus drove the
Transdanubian tribes across the river (see
C. iii. 8, Introduction). But whether this is
alluded to here must be matter of doubt.

CARMEN X.

Licinius Murena, or A. Terentius Varro Murena, as he was called after his adoption by
A. Terentius Varro, was apparently a man of restless and ambitious character, and, as we
have seen, paid the penalty of his rashness with his life (C. ii. 2, Introduction). It is
very probable that Horace wrote this ode to his friend to warn him of the tendencies of
his disposition. All else that we learn from Horace's poe-ms respecting Murena is that he
was of the college of augurs (C. iii. 19), and that he had a house at Formiae, where he
received Maecenas and his party on their way to Brundusium (S. i. 5. 37, sq.). As
Murena was put to death ΛΑΜ). 732, this ode must have been written before that year.

Although it may be inserted from the tone of this ode that Murena was uot incapable
of the conduct imputed to him and on the charge of which he died, it is but fair to him to say
that his guilt does not appear to have been proved. Dion (54. l. 3) says that, ‘⁶ in the
year when M. Marcellus and L. Arruntius were consuls, Fannius Caepio headed a con-
spiracy, which was Joined by others 3 and Murena was said to have entered into it with
them, either truly or slanderomly. The conspirators did not appear to take their trial,
and were condemned in their absence, but were taken and put to death shortly afterwards.
Proculeius, his brother, and Maecenas, who had married his sister, were unable to obtain
Murena' s pardon. ” The same historian charges him with ungovernable and indis-
criminate rashness of speech. ἀκράτῳ καὶ καταεορεῑ παρῤησίςι πρὸς πάντας ὁμοίως
