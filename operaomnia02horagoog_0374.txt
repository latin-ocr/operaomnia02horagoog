to different member-s of Herod’ s family who
succeeded to the Syrien part of his do-

20. Immo alia] Orelli says ‘ immo’

here expresses wonder at a man asking a
uestion on a matter where there is no
doubt. 1 do not see how that meaning can
be got from it. Professor Key has given
the precise interpretation of it here (L. G.
1429): ‘⁸ ⁸ Immo' seems to have signified
properly an assent with an important quali-
fication.” This explanation is borne out
by the etymology of the word, which is
compounded of‘ in’ and ‘modost (The
subject is fully discussed in Mr. Long ’s
note on Cic. Verr. ii. 1. l). The qualifica-
tion is found· ιιι ‘et fortasse minora, 'which
some editors have corrupted into ⁴ hand
fortasse minora‚' desnoying the sense and
turning it into cant. A man does not
qualify himself for a censor by proclaiming
that his own faults are as bad as those he is
blaming. ‘At' for ‘et’ is unauthorised
and unuecessary. The qualification it con·
veys is contained in‘ immo. ' The correc-
tion is Buter' s, and arose out of the
Scholiasts' paraphrase (Comm. Cruq.=)
‘confiteor me habere vitia sed fortasse
minora. '⁹ Horace means to say he admits
he has his faults, and is not so selfish and
foolish as Maenius (see S. 1. 101 of this
book), who reviled the man Novius behind
his back, aud, when told to look at his own
faults, said he made excuses for himself
which he would not make for others. No-
vius may be anybody ι we know nothing
about him. Whether he has any connex-
ion with the Novius mentioned in the
sixth Satire of this book, v. 40, the plebeian
tribune, or the usurer in v. 121 of the same
Satira, itis impossible to say. ‘Dare verba'
means to give words in the place of facts,
to deceive.
