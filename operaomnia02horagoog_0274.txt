1. temperant] This is explained by C. cording to one of the theories Herodotus

Their effect is very differently described by
Sophocles (Ant. 586), but the effect of s north-

by most of the commentatore, speaks of

northerly winde called Ornithine, which
blew for about thirty days from the 20th
February. But northerly winde prevailed
throughout the spring, end continued into

of them in the height of summer :—

3. nec fluvii strepunt] This explains
C. iv. 7. 3. The time is not quite the
beginning of epi-ing when the snows melt
and the rivers ατο swellen, bnt efter they
heve subsided, which soon takes place.

5. Nidum pauiu] The story of Ρωαιο,

from the Dict. Myth. It is grecefnlly
introduced here to give ornament to n

elsewhere introduces the swnllow with the
west wind (Epp. i. 7. 13). The swellow

account of ⁴ flebiliter gemens, ' suppose
Philomela to be intended. It is not ensyto
