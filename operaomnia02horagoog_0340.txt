EPODON LIBER, 17. 315

CARMEN XVII.

This Franke considers to be the latest of the Epodes, written with the ironiesl purpose
of making pesce between the poet and Canidia, whom he had so unmereifully lampooned‚
before the publication of the poems in which she figures. Certainly the reoentation is
not less severe than the disti-ibes. 1 do not think 1 eeeseary or feaaible to assign it a
date, and am not disposed to agree with those who fro v. 23, ‘⁴ Tuis capillus albus est
odoribus,” infer that this Epode was not written, and ΜΝ the book was not pub-
lished, till Horace wne advaneed in years, or till aiter the eompo ' ‘ n of C. iii. 14 (mmc-
729 or 73⁰), beesuse there he says his hair is beginning to turn If hie heirxtoe
perfectly blank it would only enhanee the satire of the above aseertion. mle sub-
Jeet of this quai-rel (as might be expected) is so obscure that it is useless to offer any

conjectures upon it; but no one, 1 think, ean resd this Epode and suppose thet the affair
was altogether fictitious. There is too much vigour snd genial humour in these verses to

admit of such a notion. Admitting therefore the existence in nome shepe of Canidia,
1 only deprecate the inferenees derived from a too litei-al interpretation of particular ex-

ARGUMENT.

Ι field, 1 yield3 1 pray thee by Proserpina, byDiana, by thine own mighty spells, Canidia,
eease thy charmin stay, stay thy wheel. Achilles had eompssaion upon Telephus, end
heeled him. He was enh-eated end gave back the body of Hector, and the matrona of
Troy anointed him for burial. ciroe restored the compenions of Ulysees. Surely 1
hsve been punished enough, Ο thou that art loved of sailors and of huckstere! The
complexion of youth is gone from meg my hair is white3 1 rest not day or night, and
siglis give me no relies. 1 now believe what Ι onee denied, that Sabine spells are
shaking my breest, end my head is splitting with Μαι-εἰει cherms. What wouldst thou
more? Ο see and earth, Ι am on fire, like Hercules with Nessua' blood, end Aetna's
everlasting fleme. As a crucible filled with Colchian druge thou wilt burn till 1 shall
be eonsumed, and my ashes eeettered to the winde. What death or what penalty
avaits me? Speak‚ and 1 will offer s hundred oxen, or praise thy chastity in lying
song. The brothers of Helen were enta-ested and gave the poet back his eyes; and
do thou, for thou esnst, loose me from my madness. Indeed thou art not debased by
thy perents’ einez thou dost not eeetter the new buried ashes of the poor; thy heert
is kind, thy hands sre pure, thy son is thine own, and thy births ere no pretence.

Why waste thy prayers uponears thatsre deas ss the roek lashed by the waves? Το
think thou shouldst publish and laugh with impunity⁶ et our myutie ritee, end fill the
town with my name! What proiit then have 1 of the skill 1 have learnt? Thus
shslt thou live trith strength ever renewed for fresh enduranee, ae Tantalus vsinly
eeeks to be at reet, Prometheus to be delivered from his vulture, and Sisyphus to plant
his utone on the top of his mountain. Thou wilt seek death in every form, and it
shall not eome. Ι will bestfide thee, end spurn the earth in my pride. What! must
1, who ean move images, bring down the moon or reise the denar-1, the mingler of
love-charms‚-mnst 1 see my spells of no avail for sueh as thee?
