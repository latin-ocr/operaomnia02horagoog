hed been faithful ιο Julius Caesar, but nster
hie death hod eided rather with M. Antonius
than Augustum and therefore, when the
latter had eueeeeded in putting un end ιο
his rival, aad hed the entire powerinhie
own hands, it m a bold and difficult taek
that Pollio had undet-taken. It does not
, however, that he involved himself in
any difficulty with Augustus, sor he lived
quietly ιο a good old age, dying in his
eighfieth year et his villa nt Tusculum,
'Am-c. 758, Λα). 4. A. Cremutius Cordus,
the histor-ian who was mpitany condemned
by Tiberius for having called Brutus and
Cassius the laet of the Romane, appealed in
his desence ιο the impunity with which
Pollio had expreeeed hie sentimenta (Tac.
Ann. iv. 34). It ie probable hie history
was written with impertinlity, end Augustus
wne not jealoue and could affor-d ιο be other-
mse.
