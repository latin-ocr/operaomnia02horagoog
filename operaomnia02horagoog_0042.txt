CARMEN IV.

Lucius Seeh'us sei-ved with Horace under Brutus, and they were no doubt on terme of
intimacy (see Dict. Biog. Sestius 6). But this ode hes probably ss little to do with
L. Sestius as with any of Horace’s other friends. The poet bon-owed his nume to give
point tn nn ode written st the beginning of spring und momlizing on the uncertainty of
life end the duty of enjoying it. The same remark, with a.chnnge in the names, will
npply to C. iv. ’1. 'I'noee of imitation from the Greek ere observed.by some commen-
tatore, and some Sicilisn poem containing references to Mount Aetne is fixed upon as the
source of this ode. Also it has been conjectured, that it may heve been written et

many traces of the Greek as might be found in most of Horace’s odes.

The time must be quite the commencement of the spring. The whole ‹iescdptiom in
which the present tense is used throughout, indicates the beginning of those things that
are described3 end though Ovid, referring to the mouth οξ April (Fast. iv. 129), speaks
of the hunching cf the ships,—

“ Vere mone't curvas materna per aequora puppes
Ire, nec hybernas jam timuisse nives,''--
Hornoe's words clearly refer to un earlier mouth. Rutgersius oontends very strongly
that April is the mouth to which the descriptione of this ode belong, especially vv. 11, 12,
which, he says, refer to the Palilia, the festival of Rome's birthdsy, which wns the 21st
³1³¹ss- But thetis much too late. See note on v. 11. Rutgersius contradicts himself
by snying that the allusion in v. 9 refers to the practice of Roman matrons bsthing with
their heeds crownetl with myrtle, which took place on the celends of April. Ov. Fast. iv.
