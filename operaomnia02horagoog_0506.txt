SATIRARU M ΙΙ. 3.

N unc age luxuriam et Nomentanum arripe mecum ι

Vincet enim stultos ratio insanire nepotes,

225

H ic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,

Edicit piscator uti, pomarius, ειιιοερει,
Unguentarius ac Tusci turba impia vici,

Cum scurris fartor, eum Velabro omne macellum,

Mane domum veniant.

Quid tum?

Venere frequentes· 2³0

Verba facit leno: Quidquid mihi, quidquid et horum
Cuique domi est, id crede tuum et vel nunc pete vel crae.

The mad rites of the Bellonarii, the priests
of this goddess, who cut their own flesh to

offer the blood in aaa-iiico, are mentioned
by Lucan (i. 562):

‘⁸ -- Τιιιιι quos sectis Bellona lacertis
Saeva movet cecinere deos, ·”

and there appear ω have been impostore
who, professing to be inepired by Bellona,
disturbed the peace of the city with their
cries- Martial mentions them among the
nuisances of a town life (xii. 57. ll):‘ ‘Nec
turba cessat entheata Bellonae?

228. Tusci turba impia vicu] The
Vicus hacne was a street south of the
Forum, and leading stom ‘the Forum along
the bottom of the Mons Palatinus on the
west into the Velabrum, which was the
namo os that part of the city that lay be·
tween Mons Capitolinus and Mons Aven-
tinus, from the 'fiber to the Circus Maxi-
mus. The street received its name, according
ιο Livy (ii. 14) and Dion. Halic- (v. 36),
from a body of fugitives from Porsena s
my, who were hospitably entertained by
the Romans, and allowed to occupy this
street. It appears to have been filled with
shops, some apparently of the better sort.
Martial speaks of the richest silke being
Nec
uisi prima velit (amica) de Tusco sei-ica
vico. '’ But in Plautus' day the worst
characters were found there (Curcul. iv. l.
21);· ‘In Τιιεοο vico ibi sunt homines qui
ipsi sese venditant.”'1'he Velabrum' ιε said
by Varro (Ling. Lat. iv. 8) to have derived
its name from the verb‘ vehere: because
the ground was originally a swamp traversed
by boats. Here too there appears ιο have
been a collection of shops of the better
sortz ‘⁴ prostabant omnia quae ad victus ra-
tionem atque delicias pertinebant'' (comm.
Cruq.). There were in earlier times diffe-
rent markets for the sale of different pro·

sold iu the Vicus 'l'uscus (xi. 27. ll): ‘⁴

visione, as the ‘ forum boarium ’ for oxen,
‘olitorium ’ for vegetables, ⁴ piscarium ⁹ and
‘ piscatorium ' for fish, ⁸ cupedinis ' for deli·
cacies, &c- These were asterwards (the
time ia uncertain) all transferred ιο one
large market on the site of the ‘ forum cupe-
dinis‚’ on the north side of the Sacra Via,
not far from the Forum Romanum. This
market was called Macellum, the diminu-
tive form of ⁴ maceria,’ the wall with which
it was surrounded (see Cic. in Verr. ii. 3.
62, Mr. Long's note). Varro says it was
from one A. Macellus, a notorious robber,
who had a house in this place, which, when
he was banished, was pulled down, and on
the spot was built with the money realized
by the sale of his property this mai-ket- place.
He also derives Forum Cupedinis from the
names of one Numerius Equitius Cupes,
au accomplice of the above Macellus· , but
these etymologies are not to be trusted.
See Terence (Eun. ii. 2. 24)=

‘¹ -- interea loci ad Macellum ubi ad-
ventamus
Concurrunt laeti ιιιί obviam cupedinarii
Οεῗιῗιῐίιῗῗὲιιιὶἱ, coqui, fartores, piscatores.”

⁸ Fartores' Becker (Gallus, sc. ix. n.) says
were mrn'irat, whose business was to satten
fowls. The‘ scurrae, ’pau-asim, were sent
for to help to consume all this quantity of
provisions, and to entertain the new heir.
230. Quid tum 7] This is the reading
of all but a very few MSS. Bentley found
‘quitum’ in one, and changed it ιο· qui
cum, ’which reading has since been found
in three MSS. byg Pes, who adopts it.
‘Quid enim. >⁹ is another various reading,
‘quid tu?’ a third· but this is only‘ uid
tum' with the mark (ιἰ) omitted. e
common reading' is not likely to have been
introduced is Horace had written ‘qui
cum!
232. vel nuuc pete vel cram] This
sounds like a conventionalism for ⁸ when-

ever you pleaael ·
