CARMEN vul.

A.n.c. 737.

The nppointment ol Horace to eompose the prineipnl ode nt the Secula· Gemes Amne.
737 seems to have given him much pleesure, end to heve given his mind n new stimulus
in favour os ode-writing. To the honour thus conferi-ed upon him we owe, perhaps es
much es to August-2⁸³ hidding‚ this fourth book, of which the third, sixth, eightli, end ninth
211 beer marks of the legitimete pride that circumstance ewekened. This sixth odeis e
kind of prefnee to the Secular- Ode, end dwells chiefly on the praises of Apollo es having
been the slnyer of Achilles, end thereby having preserved Aeneas to be the founder os the
Romen family ε end having preyed for md obtained the help of thot god for the tesk be
is going to perform, Horace turns, ss ohomgm, to the members of his chorus, ond
insti-ueto them in their duty.

ARGUMENT.

O thou, the punishm- οἰ Niobe und Tityos, end the slnyer of Achilles, he who shook the
wells of Tmy was no match for thee, but fell under thy strength ss the pine-tree laid
low by the axe, or the eyprees by the east wind. He would have taken Troy, not by
guile but by eruel force, bnt thet Jove hed granted Aeneas to thy prayer-s and those of
his deur Venus. Ο Apollo, support the honour of the Romen muse. His spirit is upon
me ε ye virg-ins and boys, keep time to my song und sing of Apollo end Diens- Ο
dnmsel, when n bride thou shalt look beck and say, “ When the ege brought beck its
festival, 1 song the pleasant song thet the poet Horace made.”
