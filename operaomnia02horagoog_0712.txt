EPISTOLARUM ΙΙ. 2. 687

Intervalla vides humane commoda. Verum 7ο
Purae sunt plateae, nihil ut meditantibus obstet.

Festinat calidus mulis gerulisque redemptor,

Torquet nune lapidem, nune ingens maelfina tignum,

Tristia robustis luctantur funera plaustriS,

Hae rabiosa fugit canis‚.hae lutulenta ruit sus: 75
Ι nune et versus tecum meditare canoros.

Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus et fugit urbem,
Rite cliens Bacchi somno gaudentis et umbra:

Tu me inter strepitus nocturnos atque diurnos

Vis canere et eontracta sequi vestigia vatum! 80
Ingenium sibi quod vacuas desumpsit Athenas,

Et studiis anno septem dedit insenuitque
