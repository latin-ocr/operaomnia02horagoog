HORATII FLAOGI

Ac venerata Ceres ita culmo surgeret alto,

Explicuit vino contractae seria frontis.

Nam propriae telluris herum natura neque illum

expression is very singular, und like other
phrases in Horace which have u conven-
tioml aspect we may have to go further then
the sun-face for the explanation of it. Bentley
cun only suggest the substitution of ‘ cupa '
for ‘ culpn: and by ⁴ cupa' he under-stands
⁶ eopa,’ the hostem os a neighbouring tavern
where Ofella bought the wine to enter-tuin
his friend. But why he should call her
⁴ magistra? or what particular oport there
could be in drinking ⁶ copa magistru,’ Bent-
ley does not say. He also suggests ‘nullast
but prefers ‘ cupu,’ which is more ingenious.
Porcell. supposes ⁴ cupa ' to be the reading,
but is doubtful whether he taken it with
Lambinus for the wine-vessel of that name,
which was us big us a hogshead, or with Bent-
ley for the hostese. Heindorf reads ‘culpa‚'
but supposes they played at some geme, and
that the penalty of any misteke committed
by either party wan to drink off u cup of
wine, which would be rather a premium
upon mistnkec than u penalty.
