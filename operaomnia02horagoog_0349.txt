ARGUMENT.

Maecenas, why is it thet no man is content with his own lot, but every one envies his
neighbour? The weury soldier envies the tradet-3 the trader on the stormy deep
envies the soldier3 the jurisconsult, impetierit of his early client, envies the country·
men, who drsgged up to town by s law suit, envies the inhabitants of the town. There
is no end to the instsnoes. well, suppose some god were to offer them their wish,
und bid them change placem—they would resuse it 1 What hinders the wrsth of heaven
from visiting these murmurem, and the ears of Jove being closed against them for
ever? But to be serious (though truth may be told in jest), the toiling ploughman,
the chesting host, the soldier, the venturous trader, pretend their only object is to
secure s provision for old ege, like the ant provident of the future. But she retii-es
when the winter comes, ond enjoys her stom while winter end summer, fire, sword,
und wsvoe obstruet not your pursuit of wealth. What is the use of treosure which
you hide like s coward in the ground? “Oh, but if you take from it you will soon
reduce it to nothing.” Be it so; but if you do not, what churms has the pile of eoin?
lf you thresh thousands of bushels of corn, you cannot eat more than me. The slave
that carries the breed ests no more than he who carries none. Live within the bounds
of nature, end s. hundred seres are ss good es s. thousand. ‘⁴ But it is so pleasant to
take what you want from s. huge hosp !'’ Nsy, 1 do not see why my bsskets ere not
ns good as your barus, if Ι cun take as much from my stoi-e ss you from yours. You
might as weil prefer to drsw a cup of wster from the swollen Aufidus rather than the
little stream by your side; but so you may find that your life is the penalty of your
greediness, while another gets his water clear and keeps his life from drowning. But
most men think they never een have enough. The more you have, ssy they, the more
you will be thought of. Now what is to be done with a mun of this sort? You esu
only leave him in the misery he prefers3 ss the miser nt Athens, when the people
hissed him, said, ‘⁴ Never mind 3 I look st my money-box when Ι get home, und applaud
myself.” Tantalus eatches st the retreating waters—why smile Ρ Chsnge the nume,
und the story belongs to you. Even thus you glost over your money ss you would
gaze st e lovely picture, but you dare not use it. What is the use of money? To
buy the neoesssries of life. Το lie swake and tremble for thieves, is this your hsp-
piness? Save me from such happiness! “ But if you are rich you have anxious
friends to nurse you in sickness.” Ney, you have not one. Your wife and children,
your neighbours, and ull the town detest you. How should it be otherwise? You
prefer your money to them. Suppose you were to bestow s. little paine in keeping
the affectione of your kindred—a. blessing natum has given you at no eost of yours—
would it be all lost labour? In short, cesse your getting: having more than enough,
enjoy whst you have got, and remember the fote of Ummidius the miser. ‘⁶ Well,
but whst does au this mean? em 1 to be n spendthrift like some we know ?’' Nsy,
· this is only to bring opposite extremes into compa-rison: au things heve their limite,
on either side of which right cannot stand. So 1 go beck to what 1 began with—that
greedy men ore always dissstisfied, and envying others3 and instead of comparing
themselves with those who ere poor-er, ere always hastening to overtuke some one
abead of them, like the driver in the char-iot reee3 so that few retii-e from life as satis-
fied guests from s banquet, acknowledging with thsnksulness the blessings they have
enjoyed. But enough, or you will say 1 hsve ransacked Crispinus’ desk.
