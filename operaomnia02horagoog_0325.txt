300 HORATII FLAGOI

CARMEN XI.

Supposing that Inachia (v. 6) were admimd to be the same as the Inachia of the next
ode (which is very doubtful, for the name is fictitious, end the person is most probably
fictitious too), we should be at liberty to say that at least two years elapsed between the
composition of that ode and this ς but as neither contains any certain evidence of its date,
this compa-rison even then would be of no value for determining when they were written.
Franke compares Set. ii. 3. 325, where Damasippus charges Horace with ‘⁴ Mille puellarum,
puerorum mille furores,” with his own excuse for writing so little in this ode, ‘⁴ Amore,
qui me praeter omnes expetit Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere ’⁹ (vv. 3, 4); and from
this infers they were written about the same time. But the Satire appears to have been
written at the end of A.u.c. 7213 wherefore he infers the Epode was written in that γους
which however is not very convincing. 1 cen see nothing in the ode but a specimen of
that species of composition to which Horace first betook himself in imitation of the Greek
amatory writers. ΤΙιθ metre is artificial and difficult of adaptation to the Latin language,
and the last that any writer in that language would resort to for the expression of passion,
though in the Greek it is very expressive and tender. 1 do not believe therefore that
this ode can be identified with any precise period of Horace's life; and to imagine him
deeply in love with some young Lyciscus is quite foreign to the view 1 take of Horace’s
love poems. The name Lyciscus is probably formed stom Lycus, Alcaeus' favourite boy
(C. i. 32. ll).

ARGUMENT.

Pettius, 1 am so smitten with the heavy hand of love, who makes me above others his
victim, that 1 cannot write as I used. ’Tis two years since 1 gave up Inachia. Ah!
what a byword was 1 then 1 How 1 sighed iu company and poured out my complaints
to thee when wine hsd opened my beart! “ Has the poor man’s wit no chance against
the rich man’s purse? My wrsth is kindled ε 1 cast my modesty and my sighs to the
winds; I will contend with such rivals no more.” Thus did I boast3 but my feet
carried me still to her cruel door. And now boasting that 1 have no.woman to fear,
Lyciscus has caught my heart3 nor cen counsel or raillery deliver me, nor aught but
some new flame.

ΡΕΤΤῙ, nihil me sieut antea juvat
Scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
Amore qui me praeter omnes expetit
Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.
