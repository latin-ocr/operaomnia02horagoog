PREFAGE. · ix

have done my best to determine the date of each poem so far as
there are reasonable grounds to argue upon. The principal autho-
rities on this subject now relied upon and referred to in this book
are Franke (Fasti Horatiani, Berlin, 1839) and Kirchner (Quaes-
tiones Horatianae, Leipzic, 1834). Τ hese two writers differ mate-
rially from one another, and both of them from Bentley, who in his
Preface has laid down a scheme determining the dates of the seve·
ral books, without stating the grounds on which he founds it. It
will be seen that Ι prefer Franke's opinion on this subject to
Kirchner's, but that there are many instances in which his zeal
appears to outstrip his judgment in determining the date of par-
ticular poems.

of the other books that I have used I haye been most indebted
to Estre' s Prosopographeia Horatiana (Amsterdam, 1846), a most
favourable specimen of industry and judgment.

I have studied with much pleasure the fragments of the Greek
Lyric poets, with whose entire works Horace must have been
familiar. The little that is left may make us mourn for what is
lost. So much beauty has perished as the world will never see
again. There is more power of tenderness and passionatc feeling
in some of Sappho's small fragments than in all that Horace
ever wrote. Such passages of these poets as he appears to have
imitated, intentionally or otherwise, Ι have given, so far as they
can be gathered from the fragments now remaining, the edition of

which by Bergk (Leipzic, 1843) is that which Ι have used. Most
of them had been quoted before.

This leads me to say that I have not loaded the notes with nearly

so many quotations as most who have gone before me. Ι have
tried to confine myself to such passages as throw light upon the
text, or appear to 'have been imitated by or copied from Horace.
When Ι have met with a quotation in any of the late commentatore
