HORATII FLAOGI

Si memini Varius; cum Servilio Balatrone

and next ιο that, on the first seat of the
⁴ imus,' was usually the place of the host.
But it appears that Nasidienus resigned
that place ιο Nomentanus, probably be-
cause he supposed him better able to enter-
tain his guests than himself. The host
usually reserved the ‘ imus lectus ' for him-
self and his family, as Plutarch tells us in
, the above place. If they were not present
their places were usually occupied y de-
pendente of the host (par-saites), who filled
up the table, and helped
and entertain the company. This explains
Epp. i. 18. 10, “ imi Derisor lecti.” Some-
times these laces were occupied by ⁸ um-
brae‚' broug t by the invited guests. See
Becker's Gall. exc. ‘Triclinium.’ By ‘ sum-
mus ego ' Fundanius means that he oc—
cupied the farthest seat on the ⁶ summus
lectus! The slaves in helping the wine
began from this point, and went round till
they came ιο the ⁸ imus,’ οι· third place in
the ⁴ imus lectus.' See Plautus (Asin v. 2.
41), “ Da, puere, ab summo,

Agamin-

· tei-ibi ab infimo da savium.'' These words

Demaenetus addresses to his wife, who, as
above stated, would, according to custom,
be where he says, ⁴ ab infimo,' ⁴ ima!

- Viscus Thurinus] See S. i. 9. 22,
n.; 10. 83, n. He appears to have been a
native of Thurii, in Lucania, which was
made ι, Latin colony a.u.c. 6⁵9 (Livy
xxxv. 9), and received the name of Copiae.
But its old name, given it at its foundation
by the Athenians (is-c. 444), continued ιο
be used as well as the new. Viscus was
highly esteemed by Horace. As ιο Varius,
see S. i. ὅ. 40, n. Nothing whatever is
'known of Servilius Balatro (as to whose
cognomen, see S. 2. 2, n.) or Vibidius.
The oecond syllable of Servilius appears
from inscriptions ιο be long; the third
therefore coalescas with the last. Maecenas
had taken them with him as ⁴ umbrae,’
which means persons taken by guests with-
out special invitation from the host. See
Epp. i. 5. 28, n. The MSS. and editions
vary between ⁴ quos ' and ‘ quas! Orelli

S. i. 1. 102. Porcius Comm. (ἕως. says
was a ‘publicanus,’ as Nomentanus, ac-
cording ιο the same authority, was a ‘ decu-
manus.' This may have been true once,
but it is clear that they are here introduced
as mere parasites. Suidas, from Pluma-da,
mentions one lortius as a parasite of
Maecenas, which name is supposed ιο be a
corrupt reading for Porcius, who might in
that case be identified with the n in
the text. All that we learn of him if that
be so is that, Maecenas having bought a
handsome new table, which was not round
according ιο the sashion of the day but
oblong, aster every praise had been ex-
hausted by the company, Porcius wound up
by saying, “ You don t observo, my dear
friends, how beautifully round the table is.”
He would call black white, a square table
round, for a dinner. Here he seems to be
occupied chiefly in filling his own belly,
while the host and his other parasite are
looking aiter the guests and doing the
honours of the table. ⁴ Placentae ' were
cakes, often sweetened with honey.

and ιο explain to them the mystery of each
dislig for, as Fundanius says, the com-
munest viands were so dressed up with
sauces, that they could hardly be recog-
nised, or new sorts of dishes were put on
the table, such as the enti-aila of differ-ent
fish, tui-bot and plaice for instance. ⁸ Pas-
ser’ is described by Pliny (ix. 20) as a flat
fish, and is generally supposed to be the
plaice. ‘ Indice digito ' is the foi-esinges- z
