Impune, Lolli, carpere lividas

Obliviones.

Rerumque prudens et secundis

Temporibus dubiisque rectus,
Vindex avarae fraudis, et abstinens
Ducentis ad se cuncta pecuniae,

Consulque non unius anni

Sed quoties bonus atque fidus

ertis’ (the ablative), as if Horace meant
⁸ inertis celata,’ hidden through the neglect
of the poets. But there is no need for
such a conjecture. The text is much better
as it stands on the authority of all the MSS.

31. silebo,] Many MSS. and editors have
‘ silex-ix but ‘silebo ’ is equally well sup-
ported und reads better 1 think. So C. i.
12. 21 ε “ Neque te silebo, Liber.'' Bent-
ley takes more credit thau he is enti-
tled to for restoring that reading, since
Lambinus and most of the earlier editors
have it. His arguments in support of it
have no weight, and he is wrong in suppos-
ing ⁸ sileri’ ιο have been a lete interpre-
tation, for Cruquius’ commentator, whoever
hemay have been, had that werd before
him when he wrote thusz “Non syo te:
non ,patiar tuem virtutem silentio obscu-
ran.

32. Totve tuos patiar labores] These
lines seem ιο have reference ιο the unpopu-
larity of Lollius in connexion with his
defeat, which appears ιο be alluded ιο in
the word ‘dubiis ’ below. He may also
hsve been the object of slsnder in respect
to his personal character, which Horace
here wurmly defends. There seems to be
no other way os accounu‘ng for the amest-
ness with which he declares his innocence
of the vice of avan-icc, for instance, than ιο
suppose that fault had been laid ιο his
charge, as it was so freely aflu- his death

resisting them all, and so overcoming the

of ‘ obstantes catervas,’ δια, though these
two stanna are by no means free from ob-
scurity. Doering thinks Lollius was consul
when this was written. objections heve been
raised ιο the construction of the sentence,
by which ⁶ consul' is referred beck ιο ‘ani-
mus, ' which is mere trifling. His heart
was the heurt of a consul, which could
hardly have been expressed more plainly
than it is here. Lambinus, Cruquius‚ Bent-
ley, and othere, adopt ⁴ et ' aster ⁸ utili ' und
‘ vultu! Orelli says that all the existing
MSS. except one omit the conjunction, and
he does so. Fon-collini does not notice the
use of ‘ explicare ’ in this passage. Itis
not easy ιο render it so as st once to sstisfy
the etymology and the sense. ⁶ Expromp·
