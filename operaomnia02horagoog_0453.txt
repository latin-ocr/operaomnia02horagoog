428 HORATII FLAGGI

Nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.

O seri studiorum! quine putetis

Scilicet oblitus patriaeque patrisque, Latine

swern friends, Calvus and Catullus, but
merely to show that it required a more
vigorous taste than Hermogenes or De-
metrius possessed to appreciate or even to
read the writings of such men as Aris·
tophanes and his brethren, for whom he
had au unbounded admiration. Orelli
thinks he means to express a poor opinion
of Calvus and Catullus, towards the latter of
whom he is said by some scholars to have
entertained an aver-sion: but 1 cannot see
why ifa man were to say ofa modern English
coxoomb who could do nothing better than
plesse a circle of ladies with a popular song
and agreeable voice, that he could sing
Moere’s ballads from beginning to end but
could not understand a line of Shakspeare,
therefore he was disparaging that graeeful
song writer, between whom and Shskspeare
there cen be no compsi-ison whatever, as
there could not be between Catullus and
Aristophanes.

2⁰. quod verbis Graeca Latium] This
is a new fault in Lucilius' style not before
mentioned. Seethe note on S. 4. 6. Cicero’s
advice in respect to the consistency of our
lives is illustrated thnsz 44 Ut enim sermone
eo debemus uti qui notus est nobis, ne ut
quidam Graeca verba inmilcantes jure optimo
rideamur, sic in actiones omnemque vitam
nullam discrepantiam conferre debemus”
(De off. i. 31). ‘Seri studiorum' repre·-
sents the Greek ὀψιμαθεῖς, to whom ’Πιθο-
phrastus devotes oue of his least descriptive
characters. In‘ quine putetis' the inter-
rogative enclitic is somewhat redundant,
but not more than in many other instanoes,
as S. ii. 2. 107, 44 Uterne Ad casus dubios
fidet sibi certius >” anda. 295. 317. Orelli
says the construction is eompounded of two,

‘putatis ne. >’ and‘ qui putetis. >⁹ comparing
Plautus (Ἰὶ-ιισιιΙ. ii. 6. 43)st ‘Quine etiam-
insusse: '3¹:33³ Pars ξιξ
sibi postputarit esse prae meo commodog'
where ‘putarit' is his own reading· the
indicative' is the ordinary.

22. Rhodio quod Pitholeonti] The Scho-
liasts give us no help in respect to this
person. Tbey say he was an absurd writer
of epigrama, in which he mixed up Greek
words with the Latin. Torrentius was of

opinion, and Bentley and Weichert (Port.

Lat. Rel- p. 333) of the same, that the
person meant is a fieedman of one Otacilius,
whose name he bore (M. Otacilius Pitho-
laus), of whom Suetonius, in his life of
Julius Caesar (c. 75), says that he attached
Caesar in some very abusive verses, but
that he took it with good temper. His
name was Pitholaus, but Horace might

change that termination without violating ·

the Greek usage, as Τιμόλαος and Τιμό-
λεων, Μενέλαος and Μενέλεως, &c., are
different forms of the same name. There is
some probability in the conjecture, audit is
at any rate imwssible to name any other per-
son with whom this man can be identified.

24. ut C'laio nota ei] On ‘nota' see
C. ii. 3. 8. Here the Chian, a sweet wine,
would represent the Greek as the rougher
wine of Campania would stand for the less·
polished Latin. ἦ

26. ema Petilli f] See S. df), ιι.

27. Scilicet oblitus] Against all the
MSS. Bentley suggests, and Heindorf
adopts, 4 oblitos,' to be governed by 4 malis.’
The received reading, which addresses itself
to the suppom advocate of a mixed lan-
guage, givesjustasgoodsense astheother,
{J} wlgffimffley nffijffizhffl
binus, on good authority, since confirmed by
other MSS. ,changed to⁴ Latine. ' Bentley
and Gesner, who follows him, can find no
better explanation of‘ patris Latini' than
lnng Latinus. With ‘oblitus’ and‘ Lt-
tine' the whole runs thus· 44Υοιι
