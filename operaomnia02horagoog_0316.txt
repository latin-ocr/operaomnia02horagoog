EPODON LIBER, 6. 291

pilai, among whom not one, it appears, makes any mention of his being a poet.
Kirchner supposes Maevius to be meant, and Grotefend Bavius. But if a name is re-
tained 1 think it should be Cassius, it being admitted that the man is otherwise un-
known, and that perhaps Horace, writing when he was young, gave him more consideration
than he desei-ved in composing this satire upon him.

ARGUMENT.

Why snarl at innocent strangers, dog, and run away from the wolf? Attack me if thou
darest. 1 am ever ready to hunt the prey, while thou dost but bark and turn aeide to
fill thy belly. Bewarel for 1 have lifted my horns even as Archilochus and Hipponax
listedtheirs. IfIamattscked,think'stthou1willslandlikeachildandoey?

Qun> immerentes hospites vexas canis
Ignavus adversum lupos!

Quin huc inaneS, si potes, vertis minas
Et me remorsurum petis?

Nam qualis aut Molossus aut fulvus Lacon, 5
Amica vis pastoribus,

Agam per altas aure sublata nives
Quaecunque praecedet fera:

Tu cum timenda voce complesti nemus
Projectum odoraris cibum.

Cave, cave: namque in malos asperrimus
Parata tollo cornua,

Qualis Lycambae spretus infido gener
Aut acer hostis Bupalo.

An si quis atro dente me petiverit
Inultus ut flebo puer. ²

Although‘ quin' is It does not, therefore, express ‘praesidium

phi‘nly ιιι this combination only equivalent
to‘ qui ’and a negative, taken interroga-
tively, it is sometimes used (especially by
Terence) with the imperative mood, ss
οὔκουν· ιιι Greek. Hence many MSS. have
‘'verte and ‘pete,’ which readings are
found in the Venetian edition of 1483,
notwithstanding the metrical difficulty,
which Oraquius gets rid of by putting
‘verte’ before ‘si potes! But the con-
struction with the imperative is conversa·
fional and dramatic, and there⁴ is no reason
to think Horace would say ‘quin verte’
when he could say‘ quin vertis,' which· is a
direct- question. An instance of‘ quin' as
a direct asser-tion, which is a conventional
secmrdnry usage, occurs in the Epode pre-
ςοὲᾱςιιε, v. 91. (See Key’s Lat. Gr. 1171,
6. Amica vis ρωτονέῦω,] Lucretius
vi.1221) speaks οἳ* fida canum vis, ’and
irg. (Aen. iv. 132), ‘odora canum vis?

et custodiam gregibus? ‘as Orelli says, but
rather seems to signify‘ a packss or some-
thing of that sort. whatever the Molossian
and gIsaconian dogs were, they were more
used for hunfing than for watching sheep,
and were loved by sh epherds because in
packs they destroyed the wolves and beasts
of prey. (See Georg. iii. 405, sqq.)

13. Lycambae— Bupalo. ] Archilochus
attacked Ly cambes, who after promising
him his daughter Neobule in marriage re-
tracted his promise, so sharply that he is
said to havep hanged himself, and the same
fate was supposed to have befallen Bupalus
and Athenis, two sculptors, who turned the
ngly features of Hipponax into ridicule.
The Scholiast Acron has confounded these
two stoi-ies, and makes Hipponax attack
Bupalus for refusing him his daughter in
marn .

maguum ut flebo puer ι’] The con-
struction is ¹ inultus flebo ut puer!
