ARGUMENT.

Ridiculous ne a monstrous picture, combining the bend of e woman with α body mede up
of benet, fowl, end fieb, ie thet poem of which the imegee ere thrown together like a
eiek mnn'e dream, whose beginning end end have no connexion.

But poete md painters moy take whet libem-ties they plenae.

Grnnted, within bounds, bnt not that they should breed monster-e, or petch up their
verses with tnwdry' imegee, out of place, like the peinter who etnck in a cyprees in his
picture of a wreck.1n short, whatever it· ιε let it be simple end uniform.

·ehort‚end becomes obscur-eg to be mouth end becomes vapidg to be sublime and
becomes turgid3 ω be humble md becomes creeping3 to be varied end produces mon-
eters. So in avoiding one error skin is needed leet we fan into its opposite.

(v. 32.) Neither would 1 be ee thet nrtist who could finish better than any one the small
details of e statue, but could not compoee a whole. Chooee your subject according
to your strength. So ehnll you find words end method, the merit of which is thet
it eeye every thing et the right time, end choosee its topice with judgment.

(v. ⁴6.) In the choice nnd introduction of words too cere is required, eo that old words
mey get new force from their connexion. Yon mey use new words if necessary, pro·
vided you do not excecd, especiany if they be taken from the Greek. Why should not
we doit ee well as the poete of old ? Worde drop in time, like the leaves of the forest ι
011 things must pei-ish: the greeteet worke of skill must decey, how much more must
lenguege? But old words will riee up again if feehion wille, for she ie the mistress of

(v. 73.) In tbe relation of martial deede Homer led the way. 'rhen elegy came with lamen·
tefion and with love, the author of which our critice heve not determined. Archilochus
wne driven by rege to iambica, which the enge adopted. To the lyre they sang of
gode end heroes, of fightere end hornen, of love md wine.

(v. 86.) Now if 1 cannot meintein the distinctione of style, how cen 1 be cnlled e poet?
Why should 1 not rather leel-n? Comedy is not ω be expressed in tragic style, nor
tmgedy in comic, though comedy may sometimes reice her tone end trngedy lower hers.
A poem must be not only fair to look et, but eweet end effecting, and must atrike the
ehord of sympathy. And the lengunge must be euited to the character. For there is
thet in our nature which adepte iteelf to every variety of circumstance, according as the
tongue sete it before us. But if the language end character do not agree it only meotes
n hugh.

(v. 119.) Then again you must either follow tradition or let your fictione be consistent.
Achillea must be the impetuous stem warrior, Medea the eevege mother, end eo on.
Or if you venture ou bringing forwnrd enew character it must be consistent throughout.

(v. 128.) It in not easy to handle subjecte which all may handle. One moy more eeeily
dumetize the fau of Troy then write a new story entirely. But ι men may make
common property his own if he doee not confine himself to ordinary common-places,
or follow hir author too liternlly and tie himself down too much. And you must not
begin ostentatiously, or the issue will be only ridiculoue, like thet of the mountain in
labour. How simple ie Homer'e beginning, ‘⁸ Tell of the men, Ο Μασο,” διο. There
is no smoke here coming efter the θεώ, but the light grows upon ue es we proceed in
the ehepe of beautiful end marvelloue taleae he carries us on repidly to the end, omite
what he cannot edom, end eo pum hie fictione together thet there is no inconsistency
throughout.
