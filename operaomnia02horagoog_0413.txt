HORATII FLAOGI

Iratis exstructa dedit risusque jocosque,
Dum flamma sine thura liquescere limine sacro

Persuadere cupit.

Credat J udaeus Apella,

Non ego: namque deos didici securum agere aevum,
Nec si quid miri faciat natura deos id
Tristes ex alto caeli demittere tecto-

Brundusium longae finis chartaeque viaeque est.

sq, six miles from the
“Little remains (says

near Torre d’
town of Monopoli.
Swinburne) except part of the ramparts,
which, near the sea, are entire as high up as
the bottom of the battlements. Sixteen
courses of large stones are still complete,
and the thickness of this bulwark' is exactly
eight γει-(13, au extraordinary breadth‚
which 1 ascertained by repeated measure-
meuts. The town seems to have been

under the displeasure os the Nymp hs, be-
cause the water was so bad. “Want of
water caused the destruction of Gnatia, ——a
scardty I had au opportunity of being made
sensible of.1 was obliged to content myself
with the water of a cistern full of tadpoles‚
and qualify it with a· large quantity of wine
that resembled treacle much more than the
juice of the grape. While 1 held the pitcher
to my llps, Ι formed a dam with a knife ιο
prevent the little frogs from slipping down
my throat. Till that day Ι had had but an

. imperfect idea of thirst'’(Swinbu1-ne,i.208).

The miracle Horace mentions appears ιο
have been a cheat of long continuance, for
Pliny mentions it likewise (N. H. ii. 111) ε
“ In Salentino oppido Egnatia, imposito
ligno in saxum quoddam ibi sam-um, proti-
nus flammam existere.” Liquefactions are
a sort of mii-acle that have not yet lost their
cha-rm for the ignorant, or their profit for
the designing. ‘ Lymphae’ aud ‘Nymphae’
are essentially the same word, but 1 am not
aware of any other place in which the
Nympha are called Lymphae.

100. Iudaeus A wella] The majority of
the Jews at Rome were steedmen, which
probably afforda the best explanation of the
synagogae of the Libertines at Jerusalem
mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles
(vi. 9) Apella was a common name for

‘liban-tini. ⁹ Their creedwas a superstition of
the most contemptible kind· ιιι the eyes of a
Roman, and a Jew was only another name
for a credulous fool. The yJews returned

their contempt with hatred, which shewed
itself in a turbulent spirit that made them
bimaita} &zzffosf‘ff‘i‘iiiist
that the gods were too happy ιο mind the
small affairs of this world, which he ex-
presses in the words of Lucretius (vi. 573:

“Nam bene qui didicere deessecnrumagere
aevum.'' See C. i. 34. 2, n.,and the Intro-
duction to that ode.

104. Brundusium] Rom this abrupt
conclusion we may judge that Horace had

got tired of his journal as well as his jour-
ney. Brundusium (Brindisi) was for cen-
turies the most important town on the

eastern-coast of Italy, chiefly through the

convenience of its position for communi-
cating with Greece, and the excellence of its
harbour. The port is double. The onter
port is formed by two promontories that
stretch off gradually from each other as
they advance into the sea, leaving a very
narrow channel at the base os the angle,
which leads into the inner port. This
stretches to the right and left, and between
the two arms or branches lay the city. In
the old Messapian tongue Brundusium' is said
to have meant a decr, the name being de-
rived from the appearance of a stag's head
formed by this inner port. ‘⁴ The whole
kingdom of Naplea cannot show a more
complete situation for trade than Brindisi.
Here goodness of soil, safety of anchorage,
and a central position are all united” (Swinb.
i. 386). Little remeius of ancient Brun-
dusium but broken pillars, frag-ments of
common Mosaic, with a few inscriptions
and coins. Its distance from Egnatia was
thirty-five miles according to the Jerusalem
Itinerary and the Tabula Theodosiana, aud
thirty· nine according to the Itinerary of
Antoninus. Tbere was a station named
Speluncae (now Grotta Rosa) midway,
where the party ma have halted one night,
and which Horace, having nothing he cared
to tell us about ιι, has passed over in silence.
