Reddas ineolumem precor,
Et serves animae dimidium meae.
Illi robur et aes triplex

Circa peetus erat qui fragilem truci

Commisit pelago ratem

Primus, nee timuit praeeipitem Africum
Decertantem Aquilonibus

Nee tristes Hyadas, nee rabiem Noti

Quo non arbiter Hadriae

Major tollere seu ponere volt freta.
Quem Mortis timuit gradum
Qui siccis oeulis monstra natantia„

it before him) substitutes‘ rectis’ for‘ sie-
eis‚' considering that sear is not e passion
to drew forth teers. But the ancients were
lese exact in πιθα-ἰδίῃς the proper signeto

men do now. Caesar describing the effect
of sear on his men seyest ‘Hi neque vultum

been led to the ποιά* reetis’ by Dryden' e
