Q. HORATII FLAccl

CARMINUM

LIBER QUARTUS.

CARMEN Ι.

ΛΑΜ). 739.

Ῑτ is clm that Horace, nster the publication os the first three books of his odes, laid
asido that style, or wrote in it only ooenaionally. So far aa his lyrical compositione ex-
puncti, if in his mne they ever did, any red passion, growing years md bodily infirmity
would naturally turn him from wrifing oden. So fn· u hic poema were mere imitationis
of the Greek, we mn understand his getting tired of that style aa he grew olda, md
turning ιο the more original and serious task which employed him in the Epistlen. Of
the lighoer sort, therefore, we find but few in this book, md those probably inserted ιο
make up ι sufficient volume. But his severer style he had not Ιοσι, and nono of hie earlier
compositionis turpans the moral md historica! odes of this book. Why he should have
mitten the first it is not easy ιο any. Ῑι was composod apparently ⁴ invita Minervas and
except the ειιιοοιὶιιιοοε of ita rhythm it has little ιο commend it. Nohody vin rond it md
believe that the man wau in love who wrote ὶι, still less that he was influenoed by ι drivel-
ling affection for tho boy Ligurium mentioned ιι the end, aud in C. 10 of this book. Por·
hap- be found ιι Greek ode that took his fancy and imitated it, and then published ittofin
hin book, not aa ο prologue ιο it, u many of the chronologiam sap—for what is them in
the ode that bears that character? The fifth verse says it was written when ho was about
fisty, which ago he ιιιιιὶιιοᾱ on the loth December, mmo. 739. Δ fragment os Alcman

<2⁰ Bergk)—

ἔρος με δ’ οὔτε Κύπριδος ἕκατι
γλυκὺς κατείβων καρδίαν ἰαίνει-

ιεοιιιιι ιο be part of nn ode which this os Ηοηοο might be imitated from. So likewiso
one os Ibycus (2 Bergk)—

ἔρος αὖτί με κυανέοισιν ὑπὸ βλεφάροις raaeip' ὄμμασι δερκόμενος
εηλὴμασι παντοδαποῖς ἐς ἄπειρα δίκτυα Κύπριδι βάλλει·
ἦ μὰν τρομιω νιν ἐπερχομένων, rank.

Ι do ιιοι modste the ode with C. iii. 26 for tho reasons there statod. But there is so much
memblaneo between this md C. i. 19 ιο ιο confirm me in tho opinion that they tre
both imitatione.

ARGUMENT.

Art thou ιι ποι· with me again, Venus? spuo me, for 1 am old. Go ιο the young. Go
ιο Paullus, for he is noble, handsome, elem. Give him the victory, md he will give
thee in retum ι mni-hle ειιιιιο in ι shrine of citron, with incense, music, and dunning
in hin home by the Alban lake. 1 have no longer ιι heu-t for love and wine, md yet,
Liguriuus‚whydo 1 vesp mddroem ortheo?
