CARMEN VI.

The 8011011001 Porphyrion says of this ode 11101 11 is directed against some man who
was given to attacking virulently unoffending persone. Acron says 1110 name was Cassius,
01111 that 110 was 0 0101111οω110 poet. Compounding these statements, and amplifying them
from his own 110011 and the langusge of the ode, Cruquine' Scholiset makes 00001110 10 be
Caesius Severus, an orator of great celebrity and bitterness, who was banished by Augustus,
01111 nster remaining in exile for twenty-five years died 0 beggam· ΑΛ). 32, more than sixty-
three years efter the composition of this ode. This Scholiast’s authority 10 destroyed by
1110 own description of Severus, who, 110 says, was very abusive and attacked the 11001 of
men, but was easily appensed by filling his belly 01111 plying him with money, for which
resson Horace compares him to a. dog, &c- This 10 1110 lunguege of a mere compilet, and
10 worthy of no credit. The silence of Porphyrion, end the positive statement of Acron
11101 1110 Cassius of this ode was a poet (which we have 110 authority for supposing Severus
was), 00 well as the exn-eme youth of Severus at the fimo it was written, are 011 opposed
to the 11011011 that he 10 1110 person 0110011011 3 end moreover 00 fm- from being 1110 cownrd
Horace describes, Severus boldly 0110011011 111011 of influenee, and suffered for doing 0ος

though therefore Comm. Cruq. has been followed by all the editore till the present
century 01111 by some 1010 commentatorum and though weichert hes done his beot to
support 11110 opinion, Ι 110 not think he 1100 succeeded. It may be allowed 11101 Aaou
