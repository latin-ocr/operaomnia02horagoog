SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 7.

Externi ne quid valeat per leve morari,

In quem manca ruit semper fortuna.

Ex his ut proprium quid noscere? Quinque talenta

Poscit te mulier, vexat foribusque repulsum

Perfundit gelida, rursus vocat; eripe turpi

Colla jugo; Liber, liber sum, dic age.

Urget enim dominus mentem non lenis et acres
Subjectat lasso stimulos versatque negantem.

89. Quinque talenta] The Attio drachma
of this period, which is here meant, was
worth about the same as the Roman de-
narius, nearly 8311. (see above, v. 43, n.).
The mina was equal to loo drachmae, and
a taient ιο 60 minae. It was worth there-
fore about 2121„ and five talentu 10601.
Davus, a Greek, reckons in the currency of
Greece. The caprice of the man’s mistress
is described as before, S. 3. 260, sqq. His
own bondage is very well described by
Cicero (Paradox. v. 2):‘ ‘An ille mihi liber
cui mulier' ιιιι perat, cui leges imponit, 'prae-
scribit, jubet, vetat quod videtur? qui nihil
imperanti negare potest, nihil recusare au-
det? Poscit, dandum est3 vocat, veniendum3
ejicit, abeundum, minatur, extimescendum.

95. Pausiaca torpes, imane, tabella ,]
Pausias was a native of Sicyon, one of the
most celebrated schools of art, where there
was a large collection of his pictures.
Many were sold by the Si onian govern-
ment to pay their debts, an most of these
found their way to Rome. A very large
one, painted with great boldness and skill,
and representing a sacrifice, was trans-
portcd to Rome by Scaurus when he was
aedile, and at the time Horace wrote was kept
in the porticus of Cn. Pompeius. His pic-
tures however were chiefly small, ‘tabellaess
and among the most celebrated was the por-
trait of his mistress Glycera as aflower girl,
Στεφανὴπλοεος (ΡΙίιι. Ν. H. lib. xxxv. c.
11, sect. 40, 5 2, sqq.,)‘ ‘parvas pingebat
tabellas maximeque p3ueros ’but Pausias
was also celebrated for his οιίωιιειιο paint-

ings, in which Pliny says he had ιιο equal.

96. Fulvi Rutubaeque Aut Pacideiani]
These are all names of gladiatore, as we
may gather from the context. Pliny tells
us it was the practice, when shows of gla-
diatore were exhibited, for the exhibitor to
set forth a picture of the games, to inform
the public, such aswe see now of conjux-ors,
circus, and the like3 and these are what
Davus alludes ιο. They were done no doubt
roughly ns he deam-ibes. ‘⁴ Pingi autem
gladiatoria munera atque in publico exponi
coepta a C. Terentio Lucano’ ” (Plin. xxxv.
c. 7, 5 33). Cicero mentions repeatedly a

gladiator named Pacideianus, as one whom
Lucilius had seen at Capua matched with
one Aserninus or Aeserninus. He quotes
the following lines of Lucilius. ·—

“Non spurcus homo sed doctus et acer
Cum Pacidiano hic componitur, optimus
Ροεὶοῗιεοξιιίιιοε natos [gladiator qui fuit

unus

(De opt. Gen. Orat. c. vi. SeealsoTusc.
Disp.iv. 21, andEp. adQn. Fr.iii. 4.)
Horace may have ιιιξοιι the name for any
gladiator in consequence of the celebrity

of this man. The MSS. and editions vary
between Placideiani and Pacideiani. Some
of the old editions have‘ placide J ani ’ Fea
refers ιο an inscription in Gruter’ s collec-

tion (p. 309, in which the name Placidianus
‘Contento pzzeutzdorgrgeagnoalgosspffie

of the gladiatore. The Scholiasta raise a
doubt upon the point, thinking the words
may apply to the spectator stretching him-
