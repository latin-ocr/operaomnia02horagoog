seen of this canai, which was nineteen miles
long, and was called in consequence De-
connovium. It is also mentioned by Lucan
(iii. 85): ‘⁸ Et qua Pomptinas via dividit uda
paludes-'⁹ Nero, projecting a junction be-
tween the Lake Avernus and the Tiber,
enlarged this canai ac. Ann. xv. 42).
The rond may have defective here·
abouts. aa it was the general practice of
travellers to exchange it for the canai, and
to make the journey by night, aa Strabo
informs ns in the above .

9. Jam nox· inducere terri-r] This ia a
parody of the heroic style, unless it be taken
from some poet, aa Ennius.

“How many more .²—you‘ll swamp the
boatl'’ says the boatinam The bank is
crowded; the passengers all want ιο be
attended ιο at once. They ruah on board,
and the boatman, afraid of hia mast up-
setting, or wanting to take as few as he can
for his money, tries in vain to keep them
out. This is one way of taking the words,
which Orelli prefers. It presumas that the
boat was hired by the party, and that they
divided the eost among them. But ⁴ dum
aes exigitur’ seems ιο mean that the fare
was collected from each passenger, in which
case the boatmen would have an interest in
taking aa many as they could get, and only
the passengers would complain of being
crowded. The collection of the fare and

terentesn miles from the place where they
gmbfrked. Virgil mentions it (Aen. vii.

‘⁸ -- quis Jupiter Anxurus arria
Praesidet et viridi gaudens Feronia luen.''

‘ Cerebrosus’ ia an old word signifying
‘ cholen-ic) Plautus uses it, and Lambinus
quotes from Nonius and Lucilius,
where it occurs. ⁸ Dolare ' is properly ιο
trim a piece of wood with an axe, ‘ dolabra!
It is only here used in this sense, ‘he
rongh-hewed him with a cndgel! Feronia
was a goddess worshipped originally by the
Sabines. There was a town and wood at
the foot of Monnt Soracte, which bore hsr
name, Lucus Feroniae, and where she was
worshipped. It ia now mlled civitella.
There was another Lucus Feroniae in the
north of Etruria, now called Pietra Senta.
The Cape, which now bears the name
Monte santo, in Sardinia, was also named
Feronia aster this goddess, on whose atu-i-
butes and worship see Smith’s Dict. Myth.
On the site of the Temple near which
Horace and hia party disembarked there
now stands, according to Walckenaer, an
old (octagoual ?) tower, bearing the name
Torre Ottofacia. Bentley’s reading ‘ lavi-
mnr’ for ‘lavimus,’ that of all the MSS.
and old editions, is not worth attending to.
All his quotations refer to taking the bath.
Horace says they only washed their hands
and face, which would be no litt-le ren-eah-
ment aster a night spent in a canai-boat.
