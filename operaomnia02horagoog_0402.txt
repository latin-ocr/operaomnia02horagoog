ealledbyAppius Claudius, suruamed Caecus,
who in his censorship (A. u. c. 441) con-
structed the Via Appia and the great
aqueduct which bore his name. Some
ruins of this town are said by Walckenaer
still to exist. Its modern name is Borgo
Lung ο. “Differtum κακῶς plenum, sc.
his qui in Pomptinis paludibus navigabant.
atque mliqnis: deest hominibus” (Acron).
The participle⁴ differtus' is formed as from

‘differcio,’ which verb is not found. ⁴ Dif-
fertus’ occurs below (Epp. i. 6. 59):‘ ‘Differ-
tum wansire forum! '³ Pes follows the Scho-
liast in taking ⁴ malignis ' absolutely. It
no doubt belongs to ⁴ cauponibus ’ in the
same sense as ‘perfidus hic caupo '.(S i.
29). 1t was to Appii Forum that some of
the Christiane, when they heard of St. Paul' s
approach, went from Rome to meet him.

Others methim staplacecslled'l'res
Tabernae (La Castana), which was about
seven miles from Aricia, and sixteen from
Appii Forum. Horace must have passed
through this town without stopping. It
was a well-known place, and from it a
Christian bishop took his title, ⁴⁴ Felix a
Tribus Tabernis.'’

5. Hoc iter] i. e. the journey from
Rome to Appii Forum, which was usually
made in one day, they took two to accom-
plish. ‘praecinctus’ is opposed ιο· dis-
cinctus} and means⁴ one wellgirtss εὔζωνος,
and resdy sor active exos-tion, running, &c-
Horsce uses the word more literally, S. ii.
8. 70: ⁴⁴ ιιι omnes Praecincti recte pueri
comptique ministrent.” Servius quotes this
place in his note on Aen. viii. 724, saying‚
⁴⁴ Vel habitum eorum ostendit qui usque ad
talos fluebat—vel discinctos dixit inhabiles
milites: omnes enim qui militant cincti sunt ι
vel inefficaces ut contra praecinctos strenuos

girdles their long garments when they are

ἕξεως ιο run or walk quick. Hence
expressions as we meet within Βοιίρῆ
“Gird up the loins os your mindss'

6. minus est yravie Appia tardis]

“Appia via non est molesta tardioribus
quia habitaculis frequentabatur ubi possunt
manere quocunque pervenerint” (Acron).

This interpretation is followed by many of
the commentators. Orelli and others think
Horace means that the Via Appia was less
fatiguing ιο the slow traveller than to the
quick3 that it was a rough road, over which
the· slower you went the less uupleasant was
thej Jourrhey —There is a reading‘ nimis'
sdopted by Fea' upon the same understand-
ing. This read was constructed with a
foundation of large squared blocks of stone,
over which was laid a coating os gravel,
until the Emperors Nerva and Trajan laid
it with silex according to an inscription
found on a mile-stone in the neighbourhood
of Forum Appii, and noticed by De Chaupy

the &avellet ⁴ ⁴ qui Romam Capua petit imbre
lutoque Adspersus” (Epp.i. 11.11). 1
think with Orelli that Horace means the road
was bad, and that they who took the Journey
leisurely escaped Jolting and inconvenience.
In one of the verses of Lucilius' Satire men-
tioned in the Introduction he says,⁴ ‘Prae-
terea omne iter est labosum atque lutosum.”
7. Hic eqo propter· aquam] ⁴⁴ Hodie in
Foro Appii viatores propter squam quse
ibi deterrima est manere vitant. Dicit
ergo Horatius se ibi coenare noluisse ne
necesse haberet bibere ” (Porphyrion).
At Appii Forum they were ιο embark at
night in a boat that was ιο carry them by
caual ιο Terracina. A party were waiting
at the same inn ιο go with them, and
Horace waited with impatience till they hed
done supper. These he means by ⁴ comites!
This canal, which was constructed by Au-
gustus in his attempt (A. P. 65) ιο drain the
Pomptiue marshes, is referred to by Strabo
