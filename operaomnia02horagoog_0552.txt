quoting as hia authority Apion‘s work on
Egyptian Antiquities, is the earliest writer
who propagated the vulgar error that there
was a nerve communicating between the
fourth finger cf the left hand and the heart,
and that therefore rings were worn on that
fingerm in particular, which absurdity (still
commonly believed) Sir Thomas Browne
has very learnedly disposed of (Vulg. Errors,
iv. 4). Gellius says the ancient Greeks
wore their ring-s on the same finger. The
reason for their being worn on the lefl: hand
is sufficiently clear, particularly when they
began ιο be setwith stones and made of
gold. They were more likely to be injured
and to be iu the way on the right hand.
Priscuswas a senator, and therefore eutitled
to wear a gold ring, which privilege did not
descend at this time below the equestrian
order. In later times it was confer-red upon
all manner of persons by the emperors.
These who were not entitled to wear rings of
gold had them of iron, according to the
most ancient practice3 and such of the
Romans of higher condition as adher-ed to
the simplicity of earlier days continued ιο
wear uon.

Nothing ia known of Priscus. He was a
senator, and therefore entitled to go abr-cad
with the ⁶ latus clavus,' which he would do
sometimes3 while at others he would ap-
pear only as an ‘eques‚' with the ⁴ angustus
clavus! He was rich enough to live in a
fine house, aud did so; but would from
caprice go and take an obscure lodging,
such as a poor man might be ashamed of.
Comm. Cruq. whohad ⁸ doctor ’ for ⁸ doctus,’
says Priscus taught rhetoric at Athens.
That word appears in many MSS 1 see no
occasion with Bentley and most of the com-

· mentators for supposing Priscus ιο have

been in the habit of going backwards and
forwerda ιο Athens.1·1e put on first one
character and then another: now a man
about town, and now talking of going to

Athens as a philosopher. That seems ιο be
all. He was just such an unstable person
as'l'igelliusisdescribedtobeins. i.3.

14. Vertumnis. quotquot runt, natus
iniqua] Vertumnus, aa his name indi-
cates, was the god who represented change.
Horace says Priscus was born when Ver-
tumnuswasangry(aeeS.8.8,p.,“1ratis
natnspariesdis atque poetis' ',) and he
strengthens it by saying all the Vertumni
that are ιο be found· as if every image of
the god were a separate divinity, and all
wereboangry together when this fickle man
was rn.

15. Scurra Volanen‘tm] Nothing is
known of this person. He had the gout,
which Horace says he richly deserved‚ and
was so given ιο gambling (which was illegal,
see C. iii. 24. 58, n.), that when he could
not handle the dice-box himself, he hired a
boyto do it for him. ‘Phimus’ was the
Greek word for what the Romans called

‘ffltinusx From the shape it was also
called ‘tunicula’ or ‘pyrgus' (ιιίἰρὲὀς)ἑ
and that word appears in the text
Scholiasta andin many of the old editions
for ‘phimum’ As ιο ‘talos,’ aee S. 3. 171,
ιι. They were not always thrown from a
box, but sometimes with the hand.

019. levius mirer ac prim· illo ,] “us
miser' is an unusual expression. The S.

- and editions vary between ‘illo’ and· ine!

Bentley and many others before and after
him have ⁶ ine! ⁶ Illo ’ gives the simpler
construction. ⁸ Prior illo ' means better off
than that man who is always changing his
character, one moment appcaring sti-iet,
another loose, iu his principles and conduct.
The superiority of the man who ia con-
sistent in vice lies in his indifference to
virtue, and the quietness of his conscience
arising from that cause. In that sense he
