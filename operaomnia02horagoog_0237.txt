212 HORATII FLAGGI

ARGUMENT.

Come, Maecenas ς the wine, and oil, md the flowers are ready. Stny not for ever garing
from a dbtnnoe at the pleasant fields of Tibur, buried in the magnifieenoe md the
uproar, the wealth and the smoke of the city. The rich man osten liltes to sup at the

poor man's table. The days of drought are oome boekg the ehepherd neela the ehtde,
the flock eeeks the summ, not a brenth ie on the river-bank& but thou nrt dietracting
thyself with imag-inm dangere. Heaven hae wisely hidden the future from man, and
does but emile et his seara. Live for the preeentg all else is like the aia-enm that now
flows in peace, now is swollen to a flood and sweeps all with it to the see. He lives
happy who lives to-day and leaves to-morrow to Retron, seeing that Jove himself enn-
not undo what is done. Aa to Fortune she is fickle, and changes from day to ὼγ. If
she stays with me I am glad, if she fliee 1 am resigned. If the εισι-ω regen 1 have no
merehandize to sear for, and mn put out into any eea with aefety in my lituo baa-k.

Non ante verso lene merum cado
Cum flore, Maecenas, rosarum et
Pressa tuis balanus capillis

Ne semper udum Tibur et Aesulae
Declive contempleris arvum et
Telegoni juga parricidae.
Fastidiosam desere copiam et

6. Ne semper udum] The MSS. vary
between ‘n'e‚' ⁴ nee‚' and ‘nom' Orelli

Orelli, though ‘ nec' would do very well.
Horace uses itin prohibitione (C. i. 9. 15; ll.
23 iii. 7. 29). -It appears that Maecenas
was nighing for the country all the time he
was detained at Rome. Telegonus, son of
Ulyeees and Circe, was the reputed founder

tween Praeneste and Tibur, but no moes
of its site remam, and Pliny says that it no
longer existed in his time (iii. 6). See Gr*-
mer (It. ii. 66).
