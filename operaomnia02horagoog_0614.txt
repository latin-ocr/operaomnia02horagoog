Macra cavum repetes artum quem macra subisti.”

Haud male Telemachus, proles patientis Ulixei:

Porrectus spatiis nec multae prodigus herbae;
Atride, magis apta tibi tua dona relinquam.”

are all familiar with the proverb of the
camel and the needle’s eye, and the rables
of Aesop abeund in improbabilities. The
cunning of the fox brings him frequently
into stoi-ies of this sort: in this instance he
over-reaches himself. In respect to ‘ cu-
mera‚’ see S. i. 1. 63, n.

34. Hae eqo si compellor] As to ‘com-
pellor,' see S. ii. 3. 297. Horace says if he
is taunted with this illustration he is wil-
ling to resign every thing3 by which he
means, if he is compared to the fox who
hadgotintoastoreand had becomesofat
he could not get out again3 in other words,
is it was supposed that he had become lazy
and sels-indulgent, and that he could not
asses-t his own liberty till he should cast off
the bounties of his patron, he was willing to
give them up3 sor he loved the peace that
waits upon poverty, not as those do who
commend it at rich tables spread with
dainties, but as one who would not ex-
change his ease and liberty for the wealth
of Arabia (respecti respecting which compare C. i.
21.‚1 iii. 24..1 Epp.i.6..6)‘A1tilia’
were fattened poultry and other birds, for
which service there were particular persons
employed (⁴ fartor-esf σιτευται ’.)

37. res-que paterque Audisti corams'

‘ssRex which is generally used in a bad
sense (C. i.4. 14, n), is here used in a
good. As to ‘audistiss see S.· ιὶ. 6. 20, ιι.
‘ verecundum ' means ⁴ reverential. ' It
expresses that feeling which Cicero says is
the greatest ornament of friendship, “Nam

45

maximum ammentum amicitiae tollit qui
ex ea tollit verecundiam” (Lael. xxii. 82).
Horace means to say that Maecenas had
always found him full of affectionate respect
and gratitudo, and what he was in his pre·

senos he was no less· ιιι his absence· but he
must not think so ill os him as to suppose
he only behaved so because he wanted to
keep his bounties3 or if he thought so let
himp see how willingly he could resign them
all, even as readily as Telemachus decliued
the horsea of Menelaus (Odyss. iv. 601,

ἒξ {5⁰ Ἰῼάκῃ οὔτ’ ἂρ δρόμοι εὐρέες οὔτε τι

45. vacuam Tibur] Orelli condemns
those who explain ⁴ vacuum ’ by ⁴ otiosum ς’
but in Epp. ii. 2. 81, “ vacuas Athenas '' he
explains in that way, and refers ιο this
passage for confirmation. On second
thoughts he seems to have changed his
mind. 1 think ‘ vacuum ' means ‘ idle!
Whether Horace a house of his
own at 'Ebur or not has been a subject of
much discussion. ln his life, attributed ιο
Suetonius, it is said that he did, and that it
was shown as his house at the time that
memoir was written. That he was much
at 'Ebur is quite certain3 that he had a
house of his own there I do not believe, for
he never mentions or alludes inddentally to

such a possession.- But there are no other
