HORATII FLAGOI

Dixeris esse satis; neque si qui scribat uti nos
Sermoni propiora: putes hunc esse poetam.
Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divinior atque os
Magna sonaturum, des nominis hujus honorem.

Idcirco quidam comoedia necne poema

Esset quaesivere, quod acer spiritus ac vis
Nec verbis nec rebus inest, nisi quod pede certo

Differt sermoni sermo merus.

At pater ardens

Saevit, quod meretrice nepos insanus amica

Filius uxorem grandi cum dote recuset,

diano ” (Porph.), which word is supplied in
Cic. (Orat. 20): “Video visum esse non-
nullis Platonis et Democriti locutionem,
etsi absit a versu, tamen quod incitatius
feratur et clarissimis verborum luminibus
utatur, potius poema putandam quam comi-
corum poetarum, apud quos, nisi quod ver-
siculi sunt, nihil est aliud quotidiani dissi-
mile sermonis.” Hence the name ‘ Ser-
mones ' given to the Satires and Epistles.
⁴ Si qui ’ is the reading of some of the
Vatican MSS„ one of the Berne, and two
os Bentley's. The editions and most MSS.
have ⁴ quis?

43. οε Mayna conaturum] This form
does not appear elsewhere in this word.
Cicero uses ⁴ praestaturus,’ and Sall. (Jug.
47) ⁴ juvaturus-³ Priscian (lib. ii.) quotes
⁴ sonaturmn ’ as irregular. Horace has
⁴ intonata' in Epod. ii. 61. The attributes
of a poet Horace considers essential, are
genius, inspiration, and dignified senti-
ments, and language suited ιο high sub-
jecte. See Virg. (G. iii. 290: ⁴⁴ Nunc vene-
randa Pales, magno nunc ore sonandum.”
Lambinus quotes from Petronius Arbiter
the following sensible remarks on this sub·
ject z—“Multos, inquit Eumolpus, juvenes
carmen decepit: nam ut quisque versum
pedibus instruxit, sensumque teneriore (tc-
nuiore ?) verborum ambitu intexuit, putavit
se Heliconem venisse. Sic forensibus minis·
‘ teriis exerciti frequenter sd carminis tran-
quillitatem tanquam ad portum faciliorem
confugerunt credentes facilius poema exstrui
posse quam controversiam umbrantibus
sententiolis pictam. Ceterum neque gene-
rosior spiritus sanitatem amat, neque conci·
pere aut edere partum mens potest nisi
ingenti flumine literarum inundante.”

45. Idcirco quidam] In reference ιο
this certain persons have raised the question
whether a comedy was or was not a poem =
‘⁴ utrum comoediaesset poema necne esset”

⁵0

(see Key’s L. G. 1423). This is a gum·
marian’s question, and depends upon the
definition assumed for a poem, in which
however imagination is generally supposed
to have a conspicuous place, and this would
exclude the comedies of Plautus and Terence,
and their Greek originals of the new comedy‚
from the title of poetry. But the same
rule would exclude much more that has
passed for poetry, with less pretension ιο
the name than Horace’s Satires or the
Heautontimorumenos. ⁴ Quidam ' signifies
the grammar-iaus of Alexandria, who are
also referred ιο by Cicero in the extract
given in a late note (v. 38), ‘⁴ video visum
csse nonnullis,” διο.

48. Differ-t sermoni] ⁴ Discrepcre,' ‘dis-
sidere,’ ⁴ distare,' ⁴ differre,' Horace uses
with the dative (see C. i. ⁴27. 5, n.), but the
ιντο last also with the ablativo and ⁴ ab!
⁴⁴ It must not be supposed, however, that
‘from’ can in any way be the signification
os the dative ” (Key's 1.. G„ 978, n.), which
remark Professor Key applies to the anaf-
logous construction in use by the poets
with verbs of taking away.

At pater ardens] Demea in the Adel-
phi and Plautus's Teuropides are instsncss
in point. ⁴ At: which usually in such
places introduces an obJection, here seems
ιο be the remark of one who supposed that
the fury and ranting of the enraged father
in the comedy might be supposed to pas-take
of the fire os poetry. But Horace dispo&
os the objection very easily. Any father
who had such a son as Pomponius for in-
stance'(of whom we know nothing more), a
dissolute youth, would probably storm at
him in much the same tems that the man
on stae stages uses. It was the sim os the
New Comedy‚ which the Roman writers
followed, to put real life upon the stage by
means of a plot natural aud probable, and
to represent men and women ss they were
