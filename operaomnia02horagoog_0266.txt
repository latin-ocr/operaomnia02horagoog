CARMINUM IV. 9. 241

the medium of statements made at s time when every one w mady to ebuso the most
vin-tuom who were out of court favour. Lollius, es we heve seen (C. iv. 2, Int.), m
defeated lxm-c. 737 by the Sigambri, but he retained his great influence with Augustus,
whom it was not easy, we may believe, to impone upon. At any rate, ir he was hypocrite
enough to deceive Augustus, Home may be excused for assigning to him excellencies he
'did not possess. The dete of the ode is not et 011 certain. The defen-t of Lollius, which
caused s great ded of alm-m et Rome, very probably raised e good many voioes against
him, eud gave m advantage to his enemies3 end it is not improbable thet Horace wrote
thia ode to meet their ettecks, end to console him under his defeat. The confident tone
thet runs through it brings the ode under tho remark mede in the introduction to Ode
⁶ of this hook.

ARGUMENT-

'think not thet my verses will diez though Homer eunde first among poete, Pinder,
Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Ama-eon, Seppho,—·-these all survive. Helen m
not the first woman that loved ς nor Ilium the only city that has been mked3 nor the
heroes of the Iliad all thet heve fought3 but the rest heve been forgotten, because they
heve no poet to sing of them. Buried virtue is little better then buried dulness. 1
vill not therefore let thy labours pass unsung, Lollius, thy sag-wity end upright-
nens, thy mind free from turice end secure from corruption. It is not the pos-
sessor of richen that is veelthy, but tho men who known how to use the gista of
Hoeven and to endure poverty, who hstes corruption, and is ready to lay down hin life
fox- his country or his friends.
