xxiv INTRODUGTION. ἃ

O. ii. 18.--This Ode stands alone. The metre' has its name from
Hipponax of Ephesus. The first verse consists of 'three trochees‚ fol-
lowed by a single syllable, long or short:

-υΙ-υΙ-υΙ-Υ-

The second of five trochees preceded by such a. syllable:

εΙ-υΙ-εΙ-υΙ-υΙ-ε

C. iii. 12.—This Ode -is also unlike any other. It is usual to divide
it into feet called Ionic (υ υ -, -), of which the two first verses con-
tain four each, and the third two, Respecting this metre see Bentley's
note. It would seem that Horace, imitating the subject of an Ode of
Alcaeus (see Introduction), tried the metre also, The Greek, as usual,
has a much finer effect than the imitation.

C. iv. 7.—This metre takes its name from Archilochus, and consists
of an hexameter verse and the latter half of a. pentameter. There are
no other Odes in this measure.

Epod. i.—x.—The first ten Epodes are in the same metre, consisting
of alternate trimeter and dimeter iambic verses. They admit spondees
only in the uneven places. An anapaest is once introduced in ii. 35.

Epod. xi. -This is one of the variatione of the iambic introduced by
Archilochus. The first verse is a trimeter iambic. The second is ἀσυν-
άρτητος, consisting of the last half of a pentameter followed by a dimeter
iambic. This accounts for the short syllable in the middle of vv. 6, 10,
26, and the hiatus in vv. 14, 24. Bentley has a note on this metre
which may be consulted.

Epod. xiii—This metre consists of an hexameter verse, with one made
up, as Epod. xi., of a dimeter iambic and half a pentameter, the differ-
cnce being that these parts are here reversed.

Epod. xiv„ xv.—'l'hese are composed of an hexameter followedby a
dimeter iambic.

. Elpod. xvi—This consists of an hexameter verse, followed by a pure
iam ic verse.

Epod. xvii—This consiste entirely of trimeter iambic verses, being
the only Ode that does sc.

The rule laid down by Meinecke‚ and adopted by many editors, which
affirms that the Odes that consist of single lines, or lines in alternate

measure, are to be divided into stanzas of four verses, appears to me too
doubtful to be adopted.
