Nec vicina subest vinum praebere taberna

Ad strepitum salias terrae gravis: et tamen urges
J ampridem non tacta ligonibus arva bovemque
Disjunctum curas et strictis frondibus exples;
Addit opus pigro rivus, si decidit imber,

Multa mole docendus aprico parcere prato.

Nunc age quid nostrum concentum dividat audi.
Quem tenues decuere togae nitidique capilli,
Quem scis immunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci,
Quem bibulum liquidi media de luce Falerni,

Coena brevis juvat et prope rivum somnus in herba;

Nec lusisse pudet sed non incidere ludum.

the farm he did not think worthy of the
name. That Horace made his own wine,
and that it was not too bad to put before
Maecenas, we know from C. i. 20. Pepper
the ancients must have got through some
channe! from India. ‘’Thus or· tus⁹ (see
Forcellff) olibanumss which‘ is a gum resin,
extu-acted from a tree called now the Bos-
wellia Thurifera, was brought chiefly from
Arabia. SeeVirgil g11(Georg. i. 57). “India

26. ettamen ur yet] This' is said with a
sort of mock compassioni. ‘and yet, poor
man! (though you have none of these oom-
forts to help you on your way) you have to
go on turning up the rough soil, feeding
the oxen, looking out for floods, and all
that-⁹ ‘Jamp ridem ιιοιι taeta⁹ implies that
Horace⁹ s property had been neglected be·
fore it came into his possession. Maecenas
had probably never resided there, and per-
haps he had not been long owner of it
(however he got it, which is not known),
when he gave it to Horace. One of the
duties the ⁴ villicus ⁹ had to attend to was
looking to the banks of the river (Digentia),
which it was apt to burst or overflow when
the rains came down beavily. Horace has
“docere’ again ιιι this connexion (A. P. 67).

“Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus
amnis Doctus iter melius-'⁹

31. quid nostrum concentum dividat]
‘What disturbs our harmony,’ or preventa
us from agreeing in opinion3 which is,
that whereas 1 can look back upon my
past enjoyments with pleasure, and am glad
to quit them now that my time os life re-
quires it to retii-e to the country, where 1

am free from jealousies and vexatione, you
are longing to get back to your former lise,
and give up the country, which many apoor
slave in the town envies you. So the ox
enviee the horse, and the horse envies the
ox, bnt my judgment is that each should do
the work he is best fitted for.

32. tenues decuere toque] The toga was
generally made of a thick woollen eloth,
but there were lighter and finer sorte for
summer. These were called‘ rasaess be-
cause the nap wss clipped close. See Mar-
tial (ii. 8⁵) :—

“Dona quod aestatis misi tibi mense De-

cembri
Si quereris,rasam tu mihi mitte togam.’⁹

‘Nitidi capilli ⁹ refers to the anointing of
the head at meals. Τ1ιε Romans in their
degenerate days carried the use of pei-fumes,
in the shspe of fragrant oils snd ointments
for the body aud hair, to grest lengths.
Scipio counted the man a coxcomb aad
something worse, ‘⁸ qui quotidie unguen·
tatus adversus speculum ornetur, cujus
supercilia raduntur,⁹⁹ &c. (Gen. vii. 12.)

33. immunem Cinarae] Though Cinara
loved money, and he had none to give, yet

she was.fond of him. As to this woman,

commonly carried on from three or four

people, or οιι particular occasions, it began
earlier. ‘Bibulum⁹ depende upon ‘scis ‘
