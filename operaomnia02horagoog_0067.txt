33. diem] For ‘diem supremam. ’ In in the day of Jerusalem ’⁹ (Ps. cxxxvii. 7),
this form the expression is like the Hebrew and ‘⁸ they that come after him shall be
which we meet with frequently in the Scrip- astonished at his day as they that went
tures. “Remember the children of Edom before were affrighted '' (Job xviii. 20).

CARMEN XVI.

The poet Stesichorus, as the story goes, lost his eyesight as a punishment for a poem
in which he appears to have repented the ordinary stories against Helen, and did not
recover it till he had written another poem recanting his opprobrious verses. Of this
παλινῳδία which is referred to in Epod. xvii. 42, and which was very familiar to the
ancients, Plato has preserved the opening verses in the Phaedrus, p. 243, A. It began
thus :— '

οὐκ ἔστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος·

οὐδ’ ἔβας ἐν νηυσὶν εὐσέλμοις,

οὐδ’ 'iacto Πέργαμα Τροίας. (29 Bergk.)
This poem had a plain purpose with which the ode before us has nothing in common.
Nevertheless it has been generally supposed tiu of late years to be an imitation of Stesi-
chorus, and some of the grammarians have prefixed to the ode the title “ Ad Tyndari-idmst
no doubt under the same impression. The foundation of this opinion appears to have
been the statement of Acron: ‘⁶ Hanc oden in satisfactionem facit amicae suae, imitatus
Stesichorum poetam Siculum qui vituperationem smibens Helenae caecatus est et postea
responso· Apollinis laudem ejus scripsit et oculorum aspectum reoepic’· He does not
therefore say that Horace imitated the ode of Stesichorus but only his example. It is very
probable, as Buttmann suggests, they got the name from the next ode and put it before
this, which contains no name nor any clue to the person addressed. Some MSS. have
the inscriptiou‘ ‘Palinodia Gratidiue ad Tyndaridemss 'and whoever invented this inscription
must have supposed the ode to have been addressed to the daughter of thet woman, whom
he lampoons in his Epodes. Cruquius’ Scholiast affirms that it is addressed to that
person herself, and there are many who follow this view of the case, among others Hein-
dorf on S. i. 8. Franke is decidedly of that opinion, and supposes this ode to have been
written about the same time with Epod. xvii„ and for the same mock purpose. 1 think,
there can be little doubt in the mind of any one who reads this poem, that it was composed
(though not iu seriousness) with reference to some verses Horace had actually written,

⁰ and that it is not a mere &anslation of Stesichorus’ or any other poem, while at the same

time there are Greek ideas in it, which he borrowed from that or some other source.
Beyond this 1 am not bold enough to go,

ARGUMENT.

Lovely daughter of a lovely mother, destroy those libellous verses how thou wilt. Cybele,
Apollo, Liber agitate not their votaries’ hearts as anger does, which is stopped neither
by sword, nor by waves, nor fire, nor by the falling of the skies themselves. When Pro-
metheus was bidden to take a part from every animal to give to man, he implanted in our
