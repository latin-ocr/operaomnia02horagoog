HORATII FLAOGI

Ut jam nunc dicat jam nunc debentia dici,
Pleraque differat et praesens in tempus omittat;

Hoc amet, hoc spernat promissi carminis auctor.

In verbis etiam tenuis cautusque serendis,
Dixeris egregie notum si callida verbum
Reddiderit junctura novum. Si forte necesse est
Iudiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,

Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis

Continget, dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter ς
Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si

Graeco fonte cadent, parce detorta. Quid autem
Caecilio Plautoque dabit Romanus ademptum

Virgilio Varioque? Ego cur acquirere pauca

Si possum invideor, cum lingua Catonis et Enni
Sermonem patrium ditaverit et nova rerum

sists in, which is, saying every thing in its
right place and time.

45. promissi carminis] A poem he is
known to have in hand, and which the pub·
lic are expecting.

46. lenuis cannasque serenata] ⁴ J udi-
dous and careful in planting his words!
⁶ Tenuis’ signifies a nice discernment. The
use of words is the next point noticed, skill
in giving by its connexion new force to an
old word, or in the intmducfion of new
terms sometimes horrowed from the Greek,
for the fashion of words is conventione! and
liable to change.

49. Iudiciis] Acron says, ‘⁴ indicia re-
rum verbs sunt, secundum philosophos.”
As to ‘abdita rerum ’ see C. iv. 12. 19, n.,
and add ⁸ fictis rerum ’ (S. ii. 8. 83 , ‘vilia
rerum' (Epp. i. 17. 21). As to thegis
see Epp. ii. 2. 117, ιι. ‘Cinctutus’ Porcel-
lini explains as wearing the ⁴ cinctu& which
he describes as a ent covering the per·
son from the breast downwmh, without
sleeves, and worn instead of a tunic. Ovid
speaks of the attendants on Pan as ‘ cinc-
tuti ’ (Fast- v. 101)= ‘⁴ Semicaper, coleris
cinctutis, Faune, Lupercis. ” It appears
therefore to mean one that is only girt about
the lower part of his body, having the arms

Grsece and the Greek colonien, the ancients
having worn only the toga.

54. Caecilio Plautoque] See Epp- ii.
1. 59. 170. Asto ‘Romanus' see C. iii. 6.
2, ιι. ‘Virgilio Varioque,’ S. i. 5. 40, ιι.
(That they were alive at this time is quite
an unneoessary assumption). ⁴ Catonis et
Enni,' Epp. ii. 2. 117, ιι.

55. 1390 cur] The words which Horace
appears to have used for the first time have
been observed in the course of these notes.
Some of those which do not appear in any
other author are mentioned on C. iii. 11. 10.
Το these add ‘detestatus' in the sense of
⁴ detained: (C. i.. l. 25), ⁸ emiror’ (C.i. 5. 8),

(8. ii. 6. 70), ⁴ disconvenire' (Epp. i. Lm),
‘ diludium ' Epp. i. 19. 47 ), ‘impariter'

A. P. 75), ⁸ elitigo' (A. Ρ. 94), ⁸ juvenari'
Α. Ρ. 246), ‘socialiter’ (A. Ρ. 258), ‘iam-
beus' (A. P. 253), ⁸ abstare' (A. Ρ. 362).
The construction he here employa is un-
usual. ‘ Ego invideor ' should, according
to usage, be ⁴ mihi invidetur‚' as ‘ego im-
peror' should be ⁶ mihi imperatur ⁹ (Epp. ἰ.
5. 21, where see note). The Greek con·
structione and phrases Horace uses are very

free from the encumbrance of the tunic numerous. See Index.

manus vesana Cethegi ” (Lucan ii. 543),
and ⁸⁴ Ipse (Cethegus) humero exsertus
gentili more parentum ” (Silius viii. 585).
The use of the tunic by the Romans was
inu-oduoed with other indulgences from
