Dic aliquid dignum promissis: incipe.· Nil est:

Culpantur frustra calami, immeritusque laborat
Iratis natus paries dis atque poetis·

Si vacuum tepido cepisset villula tecte.

use of ‘at' in replies is so common that 1 flow fast enough. So Persius (i. 106) says

think Bentley is right. ⁶ But, say you,

while the Saturnalia were going on you d

ran away to this place his farm);’ i. e. that
he might write some ing worth reading.
⁸ Well, then,’ Damasippus proceeds, ⁸ since
you have kept yourself sober, give us some·
thing equal ιο what you bave led us to
expect-⁹ The Saturnalia was celebrated on
the l7th December to represent the liberty
of the golden age of Satura (S. ii. 7. 4:
“libertate Decembri ”), and therefore one
of its chief features was the liceuse granted
for the one day that the feast lasted to
slaves. They bad all the mockery of free-
dom for a few hours, which they spent like
their betters in rioting. The feast belonged
more ιο the country than the town, and
was properly a farmers’ festival. But it
was attended with greater disturbances in
the city3 and one who wanted to be quiet
at that time would be glad ιο retire to the
country. Bentley thinks he disposes of
⁸ ab ’ by asking, how a man could run away
from the Saturnalia: were they not cele-
brated in the country as well as in the
town? The same question would apply ιο
the other reading just as well ς for if a man
went into the country during the Saturnalia,
it would be to retire from the tumult of it3
and that is the auswer, whichever reading
is adopted. Bentley joins ‘sobrius ' with
⁴ fugisti) which takes away all its force.
(Τῑὲι Nil est.- ⁸ lt’s no use! Plaut.

‘⁸ At ego ab hoc puerum reposcam ne mox
inficias eat·—

, Nihil est: nam ipsa haec ultro, ut factum

est, fecit omnem rem palam.”

The reed used by the
Romans for writing appears ιο have been
precisely the same as the ‘kulum ' now
used throughout the East. Like the pa-
pyrus, it was chiefly brought from Egypt,
and, when cut and ready for use, differed
scarcely at all from the pens we employ-

of trashy poetry, ‘⁴ Nec pluteum caedit nec
emorsos sapit ungues ;” it shows no evi-
dences of the beating of the wall or the
biting of the nails. He who was unfor-
tunate was said to have been born when
the gods were angry3 here Damasippus
adds ⁸ and the poeta too.' Compare S. ii.
7.14=”“ Vertumnis quotquot sunt natus
unquis.

9. minantis] ‘ Promising.’ For exam-
ples of this sense see Forcelliui. So the
Greeks sometimes used ἀπειλεῖνε

αὐτίκα δ’ ἠπείλησεν ἑξῃβόλῳ Ἀπόλλωνι
ἀρῖἑῧέβῇοωτὸἷοζῗέἰ. ρέεΊξὲις κλειτὴν ἔκα-

And, on the other hand, ⁴ promittere ’ is
used in the sense of ⁶ minari,’ as Oomm.
emq. observes, quoting ‘⁶ Promisi ultorem
et verbis odia aspera movi ” (Aen. ii. 96),
to which‘ passage Serv-ius gives the same
sense, but it is doubtful.

10. tepido] Comm. Cruq. writes on
this that Horace disliked the cold, and in ,
the winter was glad ιο retreat to his country·
house, where he could get plenty of wood
and a good fire. (See Epp. i. 7. 10, sq.)
But his residence in the valley of the
Licenza was itself sheltered, and probably
at some sessons warmer than Rome.
Bentley’s conjecture of ‘lecto ' for ‘team'
which he could not refrain from publish-
ing, though he did uot adopt it, lest any
one else should think of it and charge him
with having stolen it, is as bad as his haste
was unnecessary. No one appears to have
conceived or followed his emendation. 1
know no other commentator that is likely
ω have thought of Horace retiring to his
farm to enjoy the luxury of a warm bed.
