SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 8.

Indice monstraret digito: -nam cetera turba,
Nos, inquam, coenamus aves, conchylia, pisces,
Longe dissimilem noto celantia succum;

Ut vel continuo patuit, cum passeris atque

Ingustata mihi porrexerat ilia rhombi.

Post hoc me docuit melimela rubere minorem
Ad lunam delecta. Quid hoc intersit ab ipso

Audieris melius.

Nos nisi damnose bibimus moriemur inulti:

Et calices poscit majores.

Tum parochi faciem nil sic metuentis ut acres
Potores‚ vel quod male dicunt liberius vel
Fervida quod subtile exsurdant vina palatum.

functione were shown on that occasion,

when he handed Fundanius a dainty he

had never tasted before or perhaps heard

of, and yet these gentlemen knew what
living was.

31. melimela] These were a sweet sort
of rosy apple which, we leam from Varro,
were once oelled ‘musteass and afterwards

‘melimela-⁹ The derivation of the name
sufficiently marks their flavour, and Μαι-681
mentions them as vying with the produce
of the hive: “Dulcibus aut certant quae
melimela favis” (i. 44. That they hild a
higher colour when ga ered at the wane of
the moon is an invention of the nomen-
clator. His reasoning on the subject was
so absia-use that Fundanius does not pre-
tend to be able to recollect it.

34. Noe nisi damnose bibimus] See
Terence (Heaut. v. 4. 9) :—

⁴⁶ ch. At ego si me metuis mores cave esse
in te istos sentiam.
C'l. Quos? Cla. Si scire vis ego dicamt
gei-ro, iners, fraus, helluo, Gane0,
damnosus.”

Vibidius means that if this stupid dinner‘ ιε
to be the death of them, they had better
have their revenge beforehand, and drink
ruinously of the host' s wine· if they do not
they will die unavenged. ‘Moriemur inulti'
is horrowed from the Epic style. See Aen.
ii. 670· iv. 659-

35. Vertere pallor Ram parochisaciem]
Fundanius gives two reasons why the host

turned pale when he heard his guenta call
for lai-ger cups: because when men have
drank well they give a loose rein to their
tongues, and because wine spoils the palate
by destroying the delicacy of its tuate. He
might probably have added a third, for it
seems that in the midst of his ostentation
themanwasa ' . Asto‘parochi,'
see S. i. 5. 46. The host is so called as the
man ‘⁴ qui praebet aquam '³ (S. i. 4. 88).
39. Invertunt Allifanis vinaria tota]
Allifae was a town of Samnium, the capture
of which by C. Petilius in the second Sam-
nite War, 11...th 429, is related by Livy
(viii. 35). The Romans did not retain it long
this time, for fifteen years afterwards it was
captured again by C. Marcius Rutilius (Liv.
ix. 38). Comm. Cruq. says that there a
large sort of cup was made of earthenware.
This the context implies.‘Vina1·ia’is
properly an adjective, and with
‘vasa' unde ,. It means here the
‘lagena' or ‘amphorass which differed in
shape but not in use. Both were vessels
either of clay, or sometimes latterly of glass,
in which the wine was kept. Their con-
tents were usually poured into a ‘'oeater
for the purpose of being mixed with water.
These persons helped themselves from the
‘lagenass and all followed their example,
except the master and his two parasitos
(see above, v. 20). There was no sym-
posiarch, no ‘magister bibendiss and the
guests drank as they pleased. ·
