HORATII FLAGOI

Fomenta vulnus nil malum levantia,
Desinet imparibus certare summotus pudor.
Ubi haec severus te palam laudaveram,

J ussus abire domum ferebar incerto pede

‘20

Ad non amicos heu mihi postes et heu
- Limina dura, quibus lumbos et infregi latus.
N unc gloriantis quamlibet mulierculam
Vincere mollitie amor Lycisci me tenet,

Ἀλέξανδρος Ἀμμωνος υἱὸς εἶναι καὶ
κε ράσφορος ἀναπλάττεσθαι π poc τῶν
ἀ γαλμστοποίων (clem. Alex. Protrept. p.
36). The horus which are so generally
ascribed toBacchus by the poeta πονοι-γ
rarely met with on his statues ,—possibly, as
Spence suggests, from their beingsmall, aud
his head ‹xi-owned with ivy or vine leaves.
15. Quodn· meio] These lines are not
easy. He means ιο say that his wrath has
got thebctter of his love and modestyg and
he will cast his complaints to the winda,
and cease to contenti with rivale thet are
unworthy of him. This supposes the com-
mon reading‘ inaestuet⁷ to bewroug, which
1 believe ιι is. Doeriug and Gesner have
‘inaestuat-⁷ The two luter Berne MSS. of
Orelli also have‘ inaestuat,⁷ and it appears
ιο me that thet is the proper word. The
other could only be rendered as a hypothe-
tical threet (as Cruquius says) that if he
could only get up his wrath sufficiently to
cast his complaints away, he would abendon
Inachia3 which does not appear very good
sense. ⁸ si ⁷ is not hypothetica, but affirm-
ative, and the whole is a positive resolution
made one moment and broken the uext3
otherwise the ineensistency of the lover⁷s
conduct is lost. 4 Fomenta ⁷ means ‘ sighs ⁷
and ‘complaiuingn' with which grief is
sought to be relieved. brubium, 'hu-nebus,
and others take ‘fomente' for ‘alimenta’
⁸ thoughts which foster love and sorrow-⁷
hut that is disproved by the words that
follow z ⁴ vulnus nil malum levantia-⁷ Such
ineffectus! remedius are elsewhere called
‘⁴ frigida curarum fomenta ⁷⁷ (Epp. i. 3. 26).
4 Fomenta ⁷ are there glory and such like re·
warde. ¹ Libera bilis‚' ¹ umestrained wrath.’
as above (Ep. 4. 10), “liberrima indig-
natio.⁷⁷ ⁴ Impar-ibus' signifies his rivale
who are beneath him iu mind though his
betters in fortune. With the exception of
‘imparibus' and *ιὀιιιοιιιι,’ Turnebus (Adv-
ιιι. 20) gives the usual acceptation of
the passage. “Fomenta -si virili quadam
ιη’ ιιι praecordiis οωιιιιιιιιο dimiserit, prae-
sertim ingrata nec vulnus amon’s levantia-—
‘ me‚' inquit, ⁸ paulo inverecundius geram,

nec ita pudenter summittam amicae, sed
eam aspernabor desinamqn‘e sectari imparem
neque redamantem! ‘Desinet certare
summotus pudor⁷ is equivalent to‘ desinam
certare summoto pudore! Imp aribus⁷ is
the dativecase. SeeC.i.l.15p‚.u Ῑιι ·
aestuo⁷ is not used elsewhere, but Horace
is free ιιι his use of prepositions ιιι com
position, after the manner of the Greeks.
‘’Palam is usedbothas an adverb anda
preposition (see ForcelL).‘1;.sudaves-am⁷
is equivalent ιο ‘jactavenmss which use
Forcell. does not notice.

20. incerto pede] With steps that would
go one way and are forced to go anothe-
Some have interpreted‘ incerto⁷ ‘reding'
from the effecte of wine, destroying the
effect of the whole , in which the
poet obviously represents himself as making
fine boms before his friend, but su-iving ιιι
vain to keep them when he leaves him. So

‘nb-211. (ιι. 6. ιι).

“ Magna loquor ς sed magnifice mihi magna
Ex‘lffiztgt clausae fortia verba fores.
Juravi quoties rediturum ad limina nun-

0πέῃέἱῖιὲ juravi pes temen' ipse redit. ⁷⁷

Baxter, as usual, takes ‘incerto’ διλό γ,υς
as applying to the unsteadiness of the foot
and purpose too. ‘Non amieos heu mihi
poetes⁷ is elsewhere· ‘asperas porrectum

ante fores⁷⁷ (C. iii. 10. 2), where‘ porrectum'
explains ‘lumbos et infregi Ιιιιιιε,1 ‘I wem-led
my body by lying on the hard ground

24. mollitie amor] The hiatus ιιι this
verse, and the short syllable ιιι v. 26, are
explained by the rule that, the two verses
being compo ysecl of two separate mensures.
the lut syllable ιιι each is common, and
independent of the syllable that follows.
