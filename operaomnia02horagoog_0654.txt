Da mihi fallere, da justo sanctoque videri, ’
Noctem peccatis et fraudibus objice nubem.''
Qui melior servo, qui liberior sit avarus,

In triviis fixum cum se demittit ob assem,

Non video; nam qui cupiet metuet quoque ; porro,

Qui metuens vivet liber mihi non erit unquam.
Perdidit arma, locum virtutis deseruit, qui
Semper in augenda festinat et obruitur re.
Vendere cum possis captivum occidere noli ;

Serviet utiliter: sine pascat durus aretque,

Naviget ac mediis hiemet mercator in undis;
Annonae prosit3 portet frumenta penusque.

Buttmann (Mythol. ἰ. p. 17) identifies Lo-

verns with Letous, the goddess of night.

Porcellini adopts λαβεῖν as his solution.

64. In motis ficum] Persius, speaking
of α man who was above sordid ways, says
(v. llo), ‘⁴ Inque luto fixum possis mns-
eendere nummum.” where there is s Scho-
linm which says boys used to fasten an as
to the pevement, ond smnse themselves
with watching people stop to pick it npz
ond Obbarins quotes sn old note on the
Prologne to Persius' Satires (v. 6), relsting
s similar amusement resorted to by old
men. whether this is referred to by Ho-
τωο, οι· whether any such practice existed,
is doubtful. It is very likely Horace means
no more than a man stooping to pick np sn
es from the mud, which seems to be the
origin of thst expression of Augustine’s
(Confess. v. 12), ‘⁴ lucrum luteum, qnod
enm apprehenditur menum inquinat-’⁹

67. Perdidit amm] The man who is
ever hurrying efter money and swallowed
up in the love of it is s ρίψασπιςε he hes
cest away his arms, ond rnn away from the
rsnks of virtue. If you catch him, do not
put him to death, bnt sell him for a slave,
which is ell he is fit for. He may do good

service in keeping cattle, or ploughing, or

going with his moster, the mercator, to sen,
replenishing the mnu-ket, and so forth. One
of the principal sonroes from which the Ro·
mans got their slaves in earlier times was
the prisoner-s of war. Dedere always sc-
compsnied the comp for the purpose of pur-
ehnsing them. They were sold on the spot
by motion, ⁴ sub corona) thst is with a
chaplet on their hesd to mark them for
sele. See Gellius (vii. 4) and Caesar (Β. G.
iii. 16). captives reserved to follow the
triumph of the commender were put to '
death when the procession was over (see
Bpod. vii. 8, n.). The law-writers derivo
⁸ servus ’ from ⁴ server& ns prisonem kept
for slavery were not put to death. ⁴ An·-
nons' properly significo the yeor's supply
of provisions from the harvest. ⁴ Penus'
signifies provisions of au sorts: ⁴⁴ est enim
omne, qno vescuntur homines. penus ” (Cic.
de Nat. Deor. ii. 27. 68). Here it means
all sorts of imported provisions, preserves,
&c- ‘ Penus ' is of tw0 declensions, the
second and third. The MSS. here are in
favour ef ⁸ penus’ (third), not ⁴ penum!

73. Vir bonus et capiens] ⁶ The vir-
tuous and wise mon con speok to Fortnne

alluded to is that in Euripides' play, Bac-
