ΠΤ proficiscentem docui te saepe diuque

Augusto reddes signata volumina, Vini,

Si validm, si laetus erit, si denique poscet;

Ne studio nostri pecces odiumque libellis

Sedulus importes opera vehemente minister. 5
Si te forte meae gravis uret sarcina chartae,

Abjicito potius qnam quo perferre juberis

Clitellas ferus impingas, Asinaeque paternum

Cognomen vertas in risum et fabula fias.

Viribus uteris per clivosi„ flumina, lamas ς

Victor propositi simul ae perveneris illue,

Sic positum servabis onus, ne forte sub ala
Fasciculum portes librorum, ut rusticus agnum,
Ut vinosa glomus furtivae Pyrrhia lanae, ’

2. signata volantium] Τὶιο number of
volumes would depend upon the number of
books into which the work was divided, as
each book, if it was not very long, would be
rolled on one stick. (See Epod. xiv. 8. ιι. )
Ronnd each would be wrapped a pieee of

rehment, and to this Horaee' s seal would

affixed.

3. Sa· ualidum] Augustus had very un-
certain health, ss Suetonius informs us (vit.
c. 81)= “ Graves et periculosas valetudines
per omnem vitam aliquot expertus estJ'
He had some diseases that returned an-
nually, and he was generally ill about the
time of his birth· day (sad Se p3tember) at
the beginning of spring he suffered from
cholie, and in the autumn from eatanh.
So that, Suetonius adds, in the shattered
state of his body he oould hardly bear either
eold or beat. In winter he wore an extra-
ordinary quantity of clothing, as ‚many as
four tunies with s subucula (Epp. i. l. 95),
and a woollen eovering for the cheat, and
bowser-s or leggings of some sort. In the
hot westher he slept with all the doors open
and a man to fan him. He never went out
in the sun without a broad-brimmed hat
(¹ petasus '); he generally travelled at night,
sud in s litter, and very short distnnees3
and he preferred going by sea when he
oould. He took the greatest eure of his
health: seldom bathed, and washedin *epid
water3 rarely and cautiously he used hot
medieated baths for his nei-ves. He took
little exercise latterly, snd that only walk-
ing or gently running. Notwithstanding
all this he lived to be seventy-six. His

hysician after the Cantabrian expedition
{mue 730), when he was very ill with

liver eomplaint, was Antonius Musa, eon·
oerning whom see below (Epp. 15. 3).

6. chartae,] See S. ii. 3, 2. ιι.

9. fabula fiam] Compare Epod. xi. 82

“fabula quanta fui.”

10. lamam ·] This word is only found
elsewhere in a verse of Ennius, quoted by
comm. Cruq. and by Torrentius From an
old MS. Comm. Cruq. thus explains

‘lamas ε’ “lacunas majores continentes
aquam pluviam seu caelestem. Ennius.

‘Silvarum saltus, latebras “lanasque lu-
tosas! '⁹ Acron also says: “lama est aqua
in via stans ex pluvia3' '’ and Porphyrion.

“lama est vorago. λαμὸς enim est ingluvies.
Lamiae quoqne dicuntur devoratrices puero-
¹'liiii-‘rentitisAstniiiitions an οΙᾱΒθῙῗοέἒοοῗι 333:ss
has‘ ‘eLamae πηλώδεις τόθι-σις’ ’and For-
eellini quotes Festus: “ Lacuna, aquae eol-
leetio quam alii lamam alii lustrum dieunt.”
Horace writes as if the man was going some
arduous journey over hills and rivers and
bogs, whereas he had but thirty miles or
thereabouts to go along a good rond, the
Via Valeria, which passed very near the
valley of the Digentia.

14. qlomue jin-tinae Pyrrhia lanae‚]
Comm. Cruq. says Pyrrhia is the name of a
slave in a play of Titinius, who stole some
wool and carried it away so clumsily that
she was detected. Titinius was a writer of
eomedies who lived before Terence.
rhis is formed from Pyrr ha. the name of a
town in Lesbos, like Wlaesbis, Delia, διο.
