Quamvis m·1 extra numerum fecisse modumque

Curae, interdum nugaris rure paterno ;

60

Partitur lintres exercitus; Actia pugna
Te duce per pueros hostili more refertur 3
Adversarius est frater, lacus Hadria, donec
Alterutrum velox Victoria fronde coronet.

Consentire suis studiis qui crediderit te,

65

Fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum.
Protinus ut moneam, si quid monitoris eges tu,
Quid de quoque viro et cui dicas saepe videto,
Percontatorem fugito, nam garrulus idem est,

Nec retinent patulae commissa fideliter auree,

Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.
Non ancilla tuum jecur ulceret ulla puerve
Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

Ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae

Munere te parvo beet aut incommodus angat.

though Horace does not mean to say he is
gIven to excess and wasting his time on
such matters. ⁴ Extra numerum modum-
que ⁹ is literally ‘out of time and tunel
Where the estates os the elder Lollius lay,
or who was his other son, is not known.
The two brothers, it appears, got up a
representation of the battle of Actium on a
pond perhaps in their father⁹s grounds, and
they made the slaves (⁴ pueros ⁹) act the
soldiers and sailors, while they took the
principal characters themselves, the elder
acting Augustus, and his brother M. An-
tonius.

64. velox Victoria fronde coronet] Vic-
toria is always represented as a young fe-
male with wings, and with a palm-branch
or a wreath in her hand, or both, as in a
medal of Galba in Oiselius⁹ Thes. lxviii. 2.
Orelli mentions one ease in which she is
represented without wings, but perhaps the
figure has been mistaken. Gellius (vi. 6),
discussing the use of‘ praepetes⁹ as an ad-
jective for‘ pennae, 'quotes from Mattius⁹
Iliad the line⁴ ‘Dum det vincenti praepes
Victoria palmam.’ ’⁹ Victoria had a temple
at the foot of the western slope of Mons
Palatinus, on the site ᾄ the house erected
by Valerius Poplicola. Livy (ii. 7) calls it

“Vicaepotae aedesss' a name compounded

οἷ’ vinc- 0⁹ and ⁴-pot -ior.⁹ Her statues
yvxexrpi ιέιέὂιιειοιιε. See in particular Livy

66. Fautor utroque—pollice] In the
fights of gladiatore the people expressed

75

their approbation by turning their thumbs
down, and the reverse by uplifting them.
When a gladiator had got his adversary
down or disarmed him, he looked to the
spectatura for this signal, and according as
the thumb was up or down he despatched
or spared the man. 1 suppose he took his
orders, or the mass of the spectatore took
their lead, from the personages who sat
near the ⁴ podium.⁹ (Epp. i. l. 6, n.) Thus
⁴ fautor utroque pollice ⁹ is a proverbial way
of speaking, as Pliny says (xxviii. 2): ⁴⁴ Pol-
lices cum faveamus premere etiam proverbio
jubemur.⁹⁹ See Juvenal (iii. 36):

“Munera nunc edunt et verso pollice
Queffigltibet occidunt populariter ;⁹’

on which passage Ruperti says the thumb
{3123 23⁴?ss ‘affl tissgfflssssss. ‘¹¹⁰

68. Quid de ⁸quoque viro et cui] ‘Quo-
que’ is from⁴ quis que,' not, as Bentley
takes it with Porphyrion, from‘ quis, ’with
the conjunction. The Scholiast says· “Tria
dicit. qnid dieas, de quo dicas, et cui dicas?

‘Percontator⁹ is a gossip who is always

asking questions in order to retail the
answers, generally in a perverted form.
His ears are always open to pick up remarks
(⁴ patulae ⁹), and his tongue always active to
repeat them.

72. Non ancilla tuum] See S. ii. 5.
91, ιι. as to the use of ⁴ non ⁹ for ⁴ ne.’

75. Munere te parvo beet] ⁴ Lest he be
