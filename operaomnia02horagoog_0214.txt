the dispersion of mankind, and Ta-ou the
august was reigmng at Pekin while Noah
was floating in the ark.

4. sacro—sub Ilio ε] This is Homer’s
epithet, Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον.

5. Chium-cadum] This is the same form
¹ of e 'on as ‘⁴ Laestrygonia. amphora,''
44 Sabina diota;’' and the vessels were all
the same. Compare Tibullus (ii. l. 27) =

44 Nunc mihi fumosos veteris proferte
Cufis-1530& Chio solvite vincla cado.”

On the Chian wine see Sat. ii. 8. 15. The
beat foreign wines were Thasian, Lesbian,
Chian, Sicyonian, cyprian, and Clazomenian.
Only the second and third are mentioned
hy Horace, who puts them together in
Epod. ix. 3⁴. They were mild wines. Les-
biaphespeaks of as ‘innocens’ (C. i. 17.

6. Quis aquam temperet iynibue] This is
equivalentto ‘who cangivensabath?' So
Cicero, writing to Paetus, with whom he
was going to dine (ad Fam. ix. 16, sub
fin.), says, “ ego tibi unum sumptum affe-
ram nod balneum calfacias oportebit.”
Dillen . supposes Horace to be proposing
an ἔρανος or symbola, each person contri-
buting in kind to the entertainment. 1 do
not take that view of his words.

8. Peli-qnia ffiyoribm] Cold as bad as
the Peligni know, who inhabited a high part
of the Apennines in the Samnite territory.
‘ Quota ’ means at what hour we may sup.
Bentley tells us Horace might have said
‘quotus,’ as he does in Epp. i. 5. 30. He
thinks that word would have been equally
good. Ι do not.

9. Da lunae propere novae,] The scene
is suddenly shisted to the supper-table. On
the construction with the genitive see above
(C. iii. 8. 13). Turnebus gives the right in-
terpretation of 4 lunae novae? It means the
Kalends, which was a feast day. (Compare
iii. 23. 2, 4 nascente luna.') The months of
Numa's calendar being lnnar, the association
of the new moon with the first day of the

mouth remained aster the oelendar was

altered. A cup for midnight does not ap-
pear to have any other meaning than an
excuse for another toast. 44 Dicetur merita
Noxltgoque naenia,” he says below (C. iii.
11. tribus aut novem Miscentur cyathis]

The 4 cyathus' was a ladle with which the
drink was passed from the mixing bowl to,
the drinking cup. The ladle was of certain
capacity, and twelve ⁸ cyathi ' went to the
sextarius. Horace therefore says in effect,

“let the wine be mixed in the proportion
of three cyathi of wine to nine of water, or
of nine of wine to three of water.” He
says also the poet under the inspiration of
the Muses likes the stronger proportion;

but the Graces (in other words, good breed·

ing and good temper) forbid the wine to be

drunk pure, lest it lead to intoxication and

strife. ‘Tres supra' means the three over

the largest proportion of nine, and which,
if added, would make the drink ‘merum.’
1 need not set forth all the interpretatione
that have been offered for this passage. The
above is Orelli’s, and seems to me to bethe
true one. He held a different opinion at
one time, and his Excursus may be con-
sulted by those who are not satisfied with
the explanation here given. There were
different ways of drinking healths. One
way was to drink as many cups as there
were letters in the name. Some interpret
this passage as meaning that the poet drank
nine cups to the Muses, while others to the
Graces drank but three, according to their
number. This explanation Orelli does not
give3 but 1 like it best aster his own. It
requires us to render 4 tres supra ’ 4 above
three,’ which 1 do not like. 4 Miscentur'
means that such is the usual practice, and
there is no necessity to change it to ⁸ mis-
centur-,⁹ aa Bentley has done, following Rut-
gersius. 4 Commodis‚' fit and proper 4 cya-
thi‚’ that is, bumpers. ‘A proper man' is
4 totus teres atque rotundus‚’ in whom no-
thing is wanting. The Muses are ‘impares'
as being nine in number. 4 Attonitus ’ is
