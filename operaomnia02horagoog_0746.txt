Tonsori Licino commiserit.

Ο ego laevuS‚

Qui purgor bilem sub verni temporis boram!
Non alius faceret meliora poemata. Verum

Nil tanti est.

Ergo fungar vice cotis, acutum
Reddere quae ferrum valet exsors ipsa secandi;

305

Munus et officium nil scribens ipse docebo,

Unde parentur opeS, quid alat formetque poe'tam;
Quid deceat, quid non; quo virtuS, quo serat error.
Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons:

Rem tibi Socraticae poterunt ostendere chartae,

310

Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur.

Qui didicit patriae quid debeat et quid amiciS,

Quo sit amore parenS, quo frater amandus et hospes,
Quod sit conscripti, quod judicis officium, quae

Partes in bellum missi duciS, ille profecto

Reddere personae scit convenientia cuique.
Respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo

301. rinnon· Licino comminuit]
Corum. Cruq. has the following note:
‘⁸ Licino .· nomen tonsoris famosi qui postea
dicitur factus senator a Caesare quod odisset
Porppeium, de quo hoc scriptum est epi-
tap ‘umz

⁸ Marmei-eo tumulo Licinus jacet, at Cato
balga parvo ι quis putet esseDeos? ' ’³

The name of this person is mentioned by
Juvenal (S. i. 1093 xiv. , Persius (ii.
36), Martial (viii. 3. 6, where his tomb is
mentioned); so that the name was pro-
verbial for a wealthy favour-ite. Suetonius
(Aug. c. 67) and Dion Cassius (54. 21)
both mention him3 and the Scholiast on
the above passage of Persius calls him
“tonsorem ac libertum Augusti Caesaris!
But he was a freedman of Julius Caesar,
and must have been his barber if any body's.
His history is also given by the Scholiast
on Juvenal. As Caesar's Licinus was alive
when Horace wrote, the probabilities are
against his using his name in this place.
The name was probably that of a well-known
barber of the day. (See S. ii. 3. 16. 35, n.)

302. Qui purqor bilem] The helleboro
which the ancients usedin cases of madness
is a violent purgative, and they tried to act
on the brain by relieving the stomach.
Horace says he must be a fool, since mad-
nessia essential to poetry, for taking medi-
cinas to keep his stomach in order. This
annual purgation was thought to take place

best in spring, according to Celsus (ii.
13). It does not appear that any MSS.
have ⁴ qui purger,’ though that form might
be expected here.

304. funqar viee cotia] As to ⁸ vice'
see above, v. 86, and S. i. 10. 12. Horace
says if he only kept the bile from escaping
he would beat them all at poetry. How·
ever, it does not matter, he goes ους he
will act as the grindstone which whets the
iron, though itself cannot cut. This is said
ιο be a proverbial way of speaking, taken
from a reply of Isocrates to one who asked
him why he taught others to speak, but did
not speak himself: ai ἀκόναι αὑταὶ μὲν
τεμεῖν οὐ δύνανται, τὸν δὲ σίδηρον ὀξέα
καὶ τμητικὸν ποιοῦσι.

310. Rem tibi Socraticae—chartae,]
The writings of Socrates’ disciples, such as
Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines, Antisthenes,
Aristippus, will supply matter for the true
(dramatic) poet, by teaching him the scienoo
and duties of human life.

314. Quod sit conscripta] Aster the
expulsion of the kings, the senate having
lost many of its number under the last of
them, the vacanciss were filled up from the
⁴ equites,' who were called ‘ conscripti sena·
tores! Tha others were ⁶ ς’ and the
whole body thus constituted was called col-
lectively ⁴ patrm et conscripti‚' or shortly
⁶ patres conanimi! Horace here uses ⁴ con-
scriptus' as equivalent to ‘ senator.’ It is
no where else so used. As ω ‘judicis’ see
S. i. 4. 123, n.
