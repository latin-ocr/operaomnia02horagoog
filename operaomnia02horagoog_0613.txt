. HORATII FLAOOI

“ J am satis est.'' “ At tu quantum vis tolle.'' “ Benigne.”
“ Non invisa feres pueris munuscula parviS.”

“ Tam teneor dono, quam si dimittar onustus.''
“ Ut libet ς haec porcis hodie comedenda relinques?

Prodigus et stultus donat quae spernit et odit;

Haec seges ingratos tulit et feret omnibus annis.
Vir bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse patetne,

N ec tamen ignorat quid distent aera lupinis: “

Dignum praestabo me etiam pro laude merentis.

Quodsi me noles usquam discedere, reddes

Forte latuS, nigros angusta fronte capillos,
Reddes dulce loqui, reddes ridere decorum et
Inter vina fugam Cinarae maerere protervae.
Forte per angustam tenuis vulpecula rimam

16. Βοκίρπεὸ] This is a polite way of
declining the 0 er. ‘⁸ You are very good,”
the refusal being expressed in action (see
below, v. 62 . It might mean accept-
ance, just aa t. e French say ‘ merci‚' mean-
ing ‘yes’ or ‘no,' according ιο circum·
stances. In Shakspeare’s Merry Wives
of Windsor (Act i. Sc. l), Anne Page
says to Slender, ⁸⁴ Wilt please your wor-
ship to come in, Sir?” And he answers,
bashfully‚ ‘⁴ 1 thank you forsooth, heartily;
1 am very well.”—Anne. ‘⁴ 1 may not go in
without your worship: they will not sit till
you oome.”—-Slender. ‘⁴ 1· faith 1⁹11 eat no-
thing : 1 thank you as much as though 1
did ” (“ Tam teneor dono, quam si dimittar
onustus''). A very similar scene occurs
between the maid servant and Xanthias in
Aristophanes (Rau. 503, sqq.), when, to
her ear-nest invitation ιο come in and eat of
her dainties, he answers sheepishly, κάλ·
Mai-⁸, ἐπαινῶ-πάνυ καλῶς. There is
none of this silliness here however. but the
conversational idiom is the same. (See
Cicero in Verr. ii. 3. 85, Long's note.)

22. diym‘e ait esee paratum] Several
examples of this sort of attraction are given
in Key's L. G. 1060. Orelli has collected
more on this place. See also C. iii. 16. 32,
n.. and C. iii. 27. 73, “ Uxor· invicti Jovis
esse nescis.” ¹ Dignis ⁹ is masculine: he ia
ready ιο serve those who are worthy, but he
is no simpleton; he knows the difference
between true money and counterfeit. This
kind of bean was used for counters or sham
money on the stage3 “comicum aurum”
as it is called in Plautus (Poen. iii. 2. 20).

25. Dianam praestabo me] Horace
means to say he will endeavour to show

himself worthy (referring to ‘dignis ⁹ above)
{iassisssssshffhsshiaimffiffssss ἓοῗ
obligations. He says in effectthat Maecenas
does not bestow his liberality stupidly, as
one who gave his friends what he was inat aa
readyto throwto thepigaor thefoolwho
does not know the value of his gista. He
only gave to the worthy‚ and such Horam
would try to prove himself.

26. unqu-cta fronte] See C. i. 35. 5, n.

27. Redde· dulce loqui‚] A similar in-
stance, illustrating the nature of the infini-
tive as a neuter substantive, occurs above
(S. ii. 7. 43), “Aufer Me vultu tei-:erest
See Key's L. G. 1232, sqq. t-—“ 111 the
Greek lang-uage this is so completely the
case that the article may be prefixed to
it in all its cases. The English also neat
their infinitive as a substantive when they
place before it the preposition ⁴ to? ’⁹

28. Cinarae] See C. iv. l. 4, n.

29. vulpecula] Bentley has a facetiam
note upon this, in which he appetis ιο
huntsmen, countrymen, and natural philoro-
phers, against such a menstruus notion as a
fox eating corn. He proves that they have
neither teeth to grind nor a stomach to
digest it. But the reader must go to his
note, ‘⁸ quam legisse non poenitebit‚” says
Foreellini, 1 hardly know why. It repre-
sents to me nothing but the arroganoe of
the author. He proposes, out of his own
head, ⁴ nitedula.' a ‘field-mouse,’ without
attempting ιο explain how this word has
disappeared from every MS„ and to have
been met with inno edition till his own.
The im robability of an illustiation is no
reason ἔκ· abandoning or altat-ing it. We
