67 . Metello] Q· Caecilius Metellus,
who had the cognomen Macedonicus given
him for his successes against Andriscus, the
pretender ιο the throne of Perseus, was a
political opponent of Scipiog but it need
not be sup it was on this account that
Lucilius satirized him. Horace’s way of
mentioning the subject is against that sup-
fflssae·..{¹20¹z¹333„330 {affl} :3¹53
nor feared it might turn upon themselves,
when they saw him attack Metellus. But
if Lucilius had done so because he was an
enemy of Scipi0, that alone would be asuffi-
cient gustantes against his exercising his
wit in an offensive way upon his friend,
and Horace’s argument would mean no-
thing. And Metellus’ opposition ιο Scipio
in public life was conducted without acri-
mony, as Cicero says (dc Off. i. 25. 87),
“ fuit inter P. Africanum et Q. Metellum
sine acerbitate dissensio.” (See the notice
of his life in Dict. Biog. ⁶ Metellusss No. 5.)

68. Lupo] Who Lupus was is not
certain. His name appears in many of the
fragments of Lucilius. and Persius writes
(S. i. 114), “Secuit Lucilius urbem Te,
Lupe, te Muci, et genuinum fregit in illis.”
The Scholiasts speak of him as P. Rutilius
Lupus, who was consul sanc. 664. Βιιι
Lucilius died, according ιο the most pro-
bable account, in A.U.c. 651, and in one of
his fragments speaks of Lupus as dead3
and even if we suppose that Lucilius lived
longer than the year 664, his attacks on Ru-
tilius Lupus could not well have begun in the
life-time of Scipio, who died forty years
before the consulship cf Rutilius. The
most probabis person, therefore, as Torren-
tius suggests, is L. Cornelius Lentulus
Lupus, who was consul mxi-c. 598. What
he hed done ιο provoke Lucilius' satire we
do not know, but Cicero has preserved a
verse cf his in which Lupus is mentioned.
“ Quid de sacrilegis, quid de impiis per-

Quidquid sum ego, quamvis
Infra Lucili censum ingeniumque, tamen me

jurisque dicimus?” asks Cicero, and he
proceeds τ
“ Tubulus si Lucius unquam,
Si Lupus, aut Carbo, aut Neptuni filius,

ut sit Lucilius, putasset esse Deos, tam
fflffitff‘ ἰᾚῑῗῖἲᾜ Ἐφ’·ῖᾚζᾜ
Cicerc’s argument, Lupus is claoeed with
the perjured and profligate.

Atqui Primores popula] ⁴ Atqui,' which
is a form of ‘ at quin,’ means ⁸ but he did,
did he not? ’ ⁴ Tributim,' throughout
all the tribes: he attached the optimates
and plebeians, and all without distinction.
⁴ Aequus ’ means ⁴ favour-able to.'

72. Virtus Scipiadae] On this form
see above, v. 17. See also S. i. 2. 32, ιι.
on the expression ⁸ virtus Sdpiadse,’ and
“smn- msam ω
tioned, had the cognomen Sapiens given
him, and any one who reads Cicerc's
treatise that bears his name will understand
Horace’s epithet ⁶ mitis) It would have
been worth while ιο have been present at
the scene Cruquius’ Scholiast relates of
Laelius running round the dinner-teble,
and Lucilius pursuing him with a napkin to
flog him. Lucilius was born Ans-c. 606,
and Scipio died A.u.c. 625. He was there·
fore but a boy when he thus played with
these friends; and if, as Horace's language
implies, he wrote satires in Scipio's life-
time, they were probably the mere intem-
perate sullies of youth. But Horace may
be mistaken. The fare cf these great men
ἔω cf the >simplest kind. (See note on

. i. 6. 115.

75. Ivffm Dueili cottum] Horace had
before intimated (v. 34, ιι.) that he, a
poor man's son, born in a provincial town,
was not to be compared with Lucilius, a
Roman citizen, who was rich and had a
fine house in the Forum.
