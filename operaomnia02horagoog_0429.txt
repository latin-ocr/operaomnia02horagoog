HORATII FLAGGI

‘120

Voltum ferre negat Noviorum posse minoris.

Ad quartam jaceo; post hanc vagor3 aut ego, lecto
Aut scripto quod me tacitum juvet, ungor olivo,
Non quo fraudatis immundus Natta lucernis.

120. obeundus Πᾶν-εγω] Horace says

So that, when Servius describes the statue

he goes to bed without the nervous feeling in the Forum, (ιο which Martini allude· in

that he must be up early to go

to the the sixty-fourth Epigram of the second

Forum, where a statue of Marsyas (the book,

unfortunate rival of Apollo) was erected
near the Rostra. Servius (on Aen. iv. 58,
“ Legiferae Cereri Phoeboque patrique
Lyaeo '’) says that Lyaeus was properly
loolted upon as the defeuder of liberty in
cities, and that for this reason the statue of
Marsyas his servant was set up in the Fo-
rum, with his arm lifted up, as a sign of the
freedom and wealth of the city in which
he is. According ιο Savigny (Vermischte
Schriften, i. 40), Marsyas or Silenus was the
symbol of a city having the Jus Italicum,
one part of which was a free constitution of
its own. It would therefore appear in the
Forum as the symbol of free jurisdiction.
The only representatione of Marsyas that
remain exhibit him either in the agony of
{35¹2th ωῗιίἓὶἒῖ. ‘2¹ 51⁰⁸? ⁶332ss 3Ἐᾶῗᾷ
the Grand Duke’s palaea at Florence, sus-
pended to a tree, with his arms fastened
over his head, and his feet scarcely able
ιο touch the ground, while his face shows
great pain: and there is a gem in the
Massimi collection at Rome (Agostini
Gemme Ant. p. ii. pl. 9), in which he is
represented as tied ιο a free, expecting the
knife, which Apollo (said to be meant for
Nero, who, Suetonius says, liked to be
represented in the statues of the gods and
heroes, and particularly under the person of
Apollo, for he affected much skill in music)
is handing ιο a slave. The same soene is
represented a little differently in the collec-
tion of Gorlaeus (i. lll), where the poor
wretch has lost his skin, and is writhing in
agony‚ while the slave is returning the
knife to Apollo. On the other side of this
{35123'2'320'3835222213022225h <mx
considers this ιο be the true gem, and the
other a clumsy copy. But however this
may be, “a Marsyas countenance'' was
synonymous with dejectiori and ill humour.

Thus Juvenal addi-esses Naevolus (S. ix. l):

“ Scire velim quaro toties mihi, Naevole,
00ιῖωὲῑὲ ”fi-mte obducta, ceu Marsya

“ -- fora litibus omnia fervenu
Ipse potest fieri Marsya causidicus‚'')

with his arm raised, it is probably a sign of
extreme ’ suffering3 and Horace seems to
indicate that his face was distorted, and
ascribes it humorously to his detestation of
the younger Novius, whom also, as Comm.
Cruq. says, he may mean to represent him
as threatening with his uplifted arm. who
this younger Novius was we cannot tell.
The Scholiasta say he was an usurer, and
intimate that he was of a family of usur-ers.
“ Marsyam alteram habere manum erectam
ad depellendos Novios, quod eorum foenera·
torum impudentiam non posset sustinere ”
(Comm. Cruq.). Estre supposes him to be
the person mentioned in S. 3. 21, because
Maenius being a spendthrift, we may sup-
pose Novius to have been the reverse, and
so to correspond to the character of this
usurer. This does not help us much.

122. Aa quartam jaceo .·] This does
not mean that he slept till the fourth hour,
but lay in bed reading or thinking, as he
says above, S. 4. 133: “neque enim cum
lectulus aut me Porticus excepit, desum
mihi.” The first hour he considers late
enough for any man to sleep. Epp. i. 17.
6: ‘⁸ Si te grata quies et primam somnus in
horam Delectat.” Sometimes he got up
early and went out to walk (S. 9); but as a
general rule he remained in bed till the
fourth hour, after which he got up and took
a stroll, as he had done the evening befooe3
or else, after reading and writing by him·
self (tacitum) and in bed, as much as he
felt inclined, he anointed himself with oil
and went to the Campus Martius to get
some exercise. (⁴ Lecto ’ and ‘ scripto ' are
obviously participles, not verbs, as some
take them3 nor do they go with ‘vagor,’
as Bentley, unnecessarily complicating the
sentence, affin-ms.) The Romans rubbed
oil on their limbs either before swimming
in the 'I'iber (C. iii. 12. 6, “Simul unctos
Tiberinis humeros lavit in undis;” S. ii.
l. 82 ‘¹ ter uncti Transnanto Tiberim ”), or
before their more violent exer-cisen
