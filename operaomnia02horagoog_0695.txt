But it appears that sacrifices were also
offeffld after harvest, and that the victim
was a hog, which was commonly offered to
the Lares (C. iii. 23. 4, where the feminine
is used. S. ii. 3. 165. C. ιιι 17. 5. Ερρ. i.

there he is spoken of as ‘ tutor finium :’ in
Tibullus (i. 5. 27) he is called ‘deus
agricola) end the offen-inge are different
for wine, corn, and flocks, all of which he

Pro segete spices,pro grege ferre dapem.''
Juvenal (vi. 447) mentions a hog as an
offering ω this god, to whom women
were not allowed to sacrifice, es appears
from that passage. He is represented with

The last is connected with a story of his
killing a hind which belonged to Cyparis-

145. Fescennina per benefavente lieen-
tia] Bentley, on no authority but on the
snggoetion of Bar-thius, reads ‘invecta.’ All
the MSS. have ‘ inventa! There was a
sort of rude jesting dialogue carried on in
extempore verse at these rustic sentinis,
fun of good-tempered raillery and coarse
humour. These were called ⁴ Fescennina
oerminass as is generally supposed from the

town Fescennia or Fescennium, belonging

to the Falisci (see Niebuhr, Rom. Hnst. i.
136). Other etymologia have been given
(see ForceIL). From these verses others
took their name, which were mone licentioris
and scurrilous. Epithdamia, usually of
an obscene character, were called ⁸ Fescen-
nini versus ’ (see Catullus lxi, 126, in
Nuptias J uliae et Manlii ι
“ Neu diu taceat procax
Fescennina locutio '’),

and satires got the same name, hut the sort

of poen-y with which it originated was
harmless, as Horace says (compare virgil,

Georg. ii. 385, sqq.):

‘⁶ Necnon Ausonii, Troja gens missa, coloni
Versibus incomptis ludunt risuque solnto;
Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis3

Tibullus (ii. 1. 51, sqq.) refers to the songs
of the rustice at harvest time:
“ Agricola assiduo primum aflatus araim
cantavit certo rustica verbs pede;
Et satur uenti primum est modulatus
Cat-xcx, ut ornatos diceret ante deos.
Agricola ‘et minio suffiisus, Bacche, ru-
