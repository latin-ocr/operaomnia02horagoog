ΟΑΒΜΕΝ XXXII.

This ode has caused the οοιιιιιιοηωιοη a good deal of trouble. whether it was meant
to ba an introduction to some poem Horace wrote or intended to write on one of the
events os the day, or what sort of song he was asked for and by whom, are all questions
that have been freely discussed. The question turns in the first instance on the word
with which the ode begins. The Scholiasta read ⁴ Poscimur,' on which Acron's com-
ment is ⁴ poscebatur dicta sua edere ς’ Porphyrion’s ⁴ Exigitur a nobis ut canamus! But
a large number os MSS. have ⁴ Poscimus,' which Bentley adopts atter Lambinus and all
tbe older editions. (Cruquiua, however, following his Blandinian MS„ reads ⁴ Posuimus-J)
With that reading tlte ode becomes a mere invocation of the Mune, which would suit any
poem or any subject. With ⁴ Poscimur‚' which 1 have followed most of the modern
editors in adopting, there is still no clue whatever to the occasion of the ode, and the
Scholiaets’ remarks do not help us. 1 see no grounds for Dillenbr.’s supposition that on
some important occasion Horace was asked to write a poem, aud wrote this short ode to
deprecate such a demand, and to show that his muse was not suited to such theme..
There is nothing in it of that sort. 1 have no doubt ⁴ poscimur ’ is the true reading, md
it may mean merely that the poetic ⁴ afflatus ' was on him. The abruptness of the opening
favour: that notion. See note on v. 2.
