Propter onus segnes. Uter est insanior horum ἓ
Nil agit exemplum, litem quod lite resolvit.
Si quis emat citharas, emptas comportet in unum,

Nec studio citharae nec Musae deditus ulli;

Si scalpra et formas non sutor, nautica vela
Aversus mercaturis: delirus et amens
Undique dicatur merito. Qui discrepat istis
Qui nummos aurumque recondit, nescius uti

Compositis metuensque velut contingere sacrum?

Si quis ad ingentem frumenti semper acervum
Porrectus vigilet cum longo fuste, neque illinc
Audeat esuriens dominus contingere granum,

Ac potius soliis parcus vescatur amaris3

103. litem quod lite resolvit] Which
settles one doubtful point by reising an-
other. It supposes that the conduct of Aris-

Halsord relates an instance of lunacy whi
illustratos this: “ In another well-known
cese which justified the Lord Chnnoeunr’s
issuing a writ ‘ de lunatico inquirendo,' the
insanity of the gentleman menifeeted itself
in appropriating every thing to himself and
parting with· nothing. When strongly
urged to put on e clean ehirt “he would do
it, but it must be over the ditty one3 nor
would he put off his shoes when he went to
bed. He would agree to purchase any
thing that was to be sold, but he would not
pay for it. He was, in fact, brought up
stom the King’s Bcnch prison, where he
hed been committed for not paying for a
picture valued at 1500 pounds which he had
agreed to buy; and in giving my opinion to
the jury 1 recommended them to go over
to his house in Portland-place, where they
would find 15,0001. worth of property of
every descriptiom this picture, musical
instrumente, clocks, huby-houm, and beu-

bles‚ ell huddled in confusion together ou
the floor of his diuing·room. 1 need not

106. sor-mae] Here this significa e ahoe-
maker’s lasts. It is used for moulds in which
castings are made, and would express any
shape or block on which any thing is made.

107. Avernae mercatur-ire] The poete
use the dative aster verbs, participles, and
adjectives, which signify removal or differ-
ence. See Key’s L. G. 987. Compare
C. ii. 4. 19: ‘⁸ Tam lucro aversam.” ⁴ Istis ⁷
(v. 108) is the dative under the same rule.
Quintilian (vii. 1. 11) has ‘⁶ defensioni aver·
sior ;” and this Latin use accounts for our
own ⁸ averse to!

115, chin· veterisque Πείραι’] Pliny says
respecting the age of Falerninn, ‘⁸ Falernum
nec in novitate nec in nimia vetustate cor-
pori ealubre est. Media ejus setas a quinto
decimo nuno incipit ” (N. 11. xxiii. 20).

118. nile-‘1 θοή] He might have said
⁸ immo! See S. i. 3. 20, u. A similar
mode of expression, as 1 understand the
line, occurs in Aeschylus (Eumen. 38):

δείσαῦσα γὰρ γραῦς, οὐδὲν, ἀντίπαις μὲν

sti-egula vestis sit omne pellium περίστρωμα.
