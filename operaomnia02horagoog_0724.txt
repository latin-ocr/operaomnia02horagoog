(v, 323.) The Greeks had genius end eloquenee, end loved preise above every thing.
Romen boys leern nothing but arithmetic and accounts, end how een we expect them
ever ιο write poetry worth hsving?

(v. 333.) Poets wish either ιο profit or ἱιο plesse, or ιο ioin both these together. There-
fore when you give advice be brief, that the mind may follow sud retain your precepta.
A full mind scol-ns superfluities. Also let γοαι· fiction be like truth. The elders will
not listen ιο that which is immol-el, while the younger will have nothing ιο do with severe
poeti-y. He then is universslly liked who mingles the profitnble with the pleasant.

(v. 361.) Poetry is like pointing: there is some that bears close inspection, some must
be seen st a distentam some beers hearing once, some ιο be repented osten.

(v. 366.) Mediocrityis tolerable in some things, but not in poen-y: if that does αοι mount
ω the highoet point it sinks ιο the lowest. Nevertheless‚ though they do not sttempt
other things for which they are not qualified‚ people venture upon poetry who know
nothing about it. of course! ere they not freemen and virtuous end well-to-do in

(v. 385.) You ere ιοο sensible for ιδίας but if γοα ever do write, submit your productione
ιο the jndgment οἰ your friends, end be in no hurry ιο publish them. Words once

(v. 391.) The first poete civilized mankind, so that Orpheus was said ιο move bessus end
Amphion sennes with the lyre. The philosophy of the olden time Ιιγ in stnming insti-
tutions end lsws, regulating society, building οἱιὶοος end by promoting these the poete
won their seme. Then eume Homer snd Tyrtseus urging men ιο martial deod„

princes won3 end the husbandmen rofi-abed efter his toil= so γοα need not be
mhsmed of the lyre.

(v. 408.) It is questioned whether poetry eomes by nature or by tesehing. 1 think both

(v. 419.) The rich poet buys flsttery. 1 should be surprised if such an one could distin.
