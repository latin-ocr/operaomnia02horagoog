EPISTLE VII.

On some occasion Horace, having gone into the country for change of uir on account
of his health, et the beginning of August, was tempted to stay ewsy the whole month3 end
es he hed promised Maecenas to return in a few duye, he hed perhaps got a letter from
his'friend reminding him of thet promise, end begging him to come back. Maecenas was
e valetudinarium und had probably some of the querulous selfishness that usually attende
on thet condition. We may infer as much from that ode (ii. 17), which begins ‘⁴ Cur me
querelis exanimes tuis ?'’ and he very likely felt the want of Horsoe’s society at this
time. We cun only guther the tone of his letter or messege from the character of Horace's
reply. He says he has no mind ιο risk a return of his sickness by going beck during
the autumn to Romeg indeed that he meunt to be absent at some wnrm place on the
const through the winton that he was no longer as young and cheerful as he hed been3
that he was sure Maecenas’ liberality was bestowed upon him in e generous spirit, aud
thet he did not mean to compromise his independence3 for if he could suppose such was
the cese, he would give up every thing he hed ever received rather than forfeit his liberty.
He illustr-ates his position by two etories,—one thet of the ἴοι who got into a veesel of
corn md grew so fut there that he could not get out again (which Horace was determined
to prove was not his ease), and the other e splenetic trick played by L. Philippus upon s
worthy mun whom he reduced into leaving his home end vocetion and settling on e farm
in the country, the result of which unneturul change πω the total destruction of his
peuce aud independence. Το this ιοο Horace means ιο say he will never let himself be
brought.

There is nothing disrespectful or engi-y in the Epistle, though it might appear from s
bure outline like the above, or from e superficial reading, that there was. It was written
after many years of intimacy, and shows pretty clearly the influence Horace had acquired
with his petrem for though Horace was not perhaps of e servile disposition, as servility
που then reckoned, he would not have taken this tone if he had not been sure Maecenas
would not take offence ιι ἰι.
