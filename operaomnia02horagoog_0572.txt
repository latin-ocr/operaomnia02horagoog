Pollio (Ec. viii. 11)=“A tep principium, tibi

Theou-itus also opens his panegyr-ic on
Ptolemaeus Philadelphus in the same way.

στανος ἀνδρῶν. (Idyll. xvii.)

2. Spectatum satis et donatum jam rude]
When gladiatore received their discharge
they were presented by the 4 lanista ’ or the
4 editor spectaculorum,' who owned or hired
them, with a ‘rudis,' which was a blunt
wooden instrument, some say a sword
others a eudgel. There are two geme re-
presenting as it appears ‘rudiarii‚' in Ages-
tini’ s collection, in each of which the man
carries a short round weapon like a police-
man' s truncheon. The name may have
belonged to any weapon used in the ⁶ prae-
lusio' or sham fight that generally pre-
ceded the real battle with sharp swords.
Suetonius says of Caligula (vit. ο. 32).

“Mirmillonem e ludo rudibus secum batu-
entem et sponte prostratum confodit ferrea
sica3' ” and again (c. 54).4 ‘Batuebat pug-
natoriis armis. ” There were therefore
different sorts of weap ons used‘ ιιι this way,
and ‘’i-udis may haee been the name for
any of them. yThe gladiatore thus dis-
· charged were called ‘rudiariiss and if they
were freemen ‘ exauctorati! (See above,
S. ii. 6. ιι.) 4 Spectatum ⁹ is a technical

ο term. Tickets with the letters ΒΡ upon

them were given ιο gladiatore who had dis·
tinguished themselves. ‘’Ludus means the
place where the training took place and the
gladiatore wer-ekept. (SeeA. P. 32, ιι.)

4. Veianius armis Herculis acl postem]
Veianius was a 4 rudiarius,’ and when he
was discharged he hung up his weapons in
the temple of Hercules just as the man is
made to hang up the arms of love in the
temple of Venus when they had ceased to
profit him, in C. iii. 26. 3:

’“Νῗὲιῗὶἳ· ξ·“·“““·“ἓὲιῒ.ἷ·ἒ1 ⁰

or as the slave hung up his chain to the
Lares (seeS. i. 5. 65, ιι., “Donasset' jamne
catenam Ex voto laribus’ ⁹), to whom also
boys dedicated their‘ bulla’ when they as-
sumed the‘ toga virilis' (4 Bullaque suc-
cinctis Laribus donata pependltss’ Pers. v.
31), and generally, as Turnebus remarks,
those who gave up any trade or calling
dedicated the instrumente with which they
had followed it to the gods and ιο that god
in particular under whose patronage they
had placed· themselves. Hermiles would
naturally be chosen by a gladiator, or by a
soldier as in an epigram in the Anthologia
(Brunck, vol. i. p. 254). Similar actions
are frequently represented in those epi-

his nets and quiver top Mercury (vohi. p.
223), &c- So qthe shepherd hange up his
flute on a trec to Pan (Tibullus' ii. ⁶. 29).

effiminvaeffi fistula sam deofl

All the Scholiasta tell us that Veianius hung
up his weapons in the temple of Hercules
Fundanus, and it appears that Hercules was
worshipped particularly hythe inhabitants
of Fundi' ιιι Latium (S. i. 5. 34). Orelli refers
ιο an inscription in his own collection,
No. 15393 and Obbarius on this passage
iffi. {ztffisszamsszzzfiffzff 3‘101‘30'12122
Fundanus. He had at least one tem le at
Rome (see S. ii. 6, 12, n.), and also at bur,
which was called aster him. (See note on
Ep. 2. 2.) Veiania was the name of an
Italian family. Varro (R. R. iii. 16. 10)
mentions two brothers of that name from
the Faliscus ager.
