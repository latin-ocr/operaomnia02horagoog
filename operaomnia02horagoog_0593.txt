Quae circumvolitas agilis thyma?

HORATII FLAOGI

Non tibi parvum

Ingenium, non incultum· est et turpiter hirtum.
Seu linguam causis acuis seu civica jura
Respondete paras seu condis amabile carmen„

Prima feres hederae victricis praemia. Quodsi

25

Frigida curarum fomenta relinquere posses

Quo te caelestis sapientia duceret ires.

Hoc opus, hoc studium parvi properemus et ampli
Si patriae volumus, si nobis vivere cari.

Debes hoc etiam rescribere, si tibi curae

30

Quantae conveniat Munatius; an male sarta

Gratia nequicquam coit et rescinditur.

At vos

Seu calidus sanguis seu rerum inscitia vexat
Indomita cervice feros, ubicunque locorum

Vivitis, indigni fraternum rumpere foedus,

35

Pascitur in vestrum reditum votiva juvenca.

21. Quae circumvolitas] This similitude
of a hee gatbering honey from thyme Ho-
race applies to himself (⁸0. iv. 2. 27, sqq..
where see note). As to ‘’oi-ator and‘ re·-
spondere,' sees. i. 1. 9, ιι. ,·ι.ιιάοιι hederae
praemia? see C. i. l. 29.

23. seu civica jura Respondere] This' ις

using-alar expression for the usual‘ jus
respondere: οι· ‘'de Jure respondere. ’ Pliny
has“ jus civile respondere”(Epp.6.15).

26. fflyt'da curarum fomenta] It is
not easy to decide upon the meaning of

ιἰὀιιιοιιιι here. Some suppose it significa
those selfisb obj ects, such as honour, ricbes,
δια, which seem to foster (⁴ fovere ⁹) care,
and which make the beart cold and the
feeliugs dull. Others apply it to similar
objecta, but as the remedies by which care
is Jsought to be alleviated arye “fomenta
vulnus nil malum levantia” (Epod. ιιι. 17),
Ι incline to the latter myself. (See note on
· the above Epode). They are still‘ frigidass
in the sense above given.

28. parvi properemus et ampli] As to
ἷέἶᾝέἓξὶ ὧθρῗὲριξρῗὲἱ ’ἒὲῗῖἓξξξὲ
pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque

30. εἰ tim· curae] Most of the MSS.
have‘ sit,’ but‘ si' isbetter, andhassuffl-
dent authority. ‘Si' and‘ sit’ are con·
fnsedinthe MSS. SeeEpod.i.5,n.
Horace says, ⁴ You must write me back
word whether yon make as much of Muna-
tius as he desa-ves, or whether your mutual

regard(which had been ἰιιιοιτιιριοά), like a
wouud 111 sewu, refuses to unite and is tom

Munatius Plancus, the consul of mmc- 712.
We know nothing more about him except
that he was consul in Α.ο.ο. 766, and that
he was afterwards sent as oue of the com-
missionem from the senate ιο the mutianus
German legions .Ann. i. 39). It ap-
pearsheand Florusliad ‹wumelled που-ο
ιιοι told what it was about3 but Hor-sce
attributes it to youthful hest and' ιςιιοπιιιοο
of the world. He likens them to unbroke
horses, and in terme more affectionate than
grammatical tells them that they ought ω
make it up. and that when they come home
theywillfind thefatted calfreadyforsaui-
fiee. Compei-ec. i. 36, writtenonthere-
turn of Numida. It ις impossible to t
the difl'mnt parts of the sentence er
so as to make the construction regular aud
natural, but the sense is clear enough. Ho-
race frequently uses ‘ dignus ’ with the in-
finin‘ve. See C. ιιι. 21. 6, ιι. ⁴ Indignus ’ he
uses ιιι the same wayhere and ιιι Δ. Ρ. 231,
but in the usual prose construction with ⁸ qui'
and the subjunctive in 8. ii. 3. 236. Ριοιιι

‘fraternum foedus’ Comm. Cruq. makes
them brothers. Horace only means that
they wereorhad been andoqght tobe

“paene gemelli ,haten-nis animis} as he
says below, Epp. 10. 3.
