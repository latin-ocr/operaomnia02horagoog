Q. HORATII FLAOGI

SATIRARUM

LIBER PRIMUS.

SATIRE I.

'rho professed purpose of this Setire, or that with which Horace seems to hsve begun,
may be gethei-ed from the first two lines. Discontent with the condition thet Providence
hes assigned them disappointment with the position many γεω-ε’ lebour end perhaps
dishonesty heve gained them3 envy of their neighbours' circumstances, even if they
worse than their οπως dissau'sfsction in short with what they heve end ere, end (πενίης
for something they heve not and ere not,-—these are features common to the great ms-
jority of men. For this vice of discontent the Greeks hed the comprehensive name
μεμψιμοιρία. It ufforde a wide field forestis-e, end could only be touched lighfly, or in
one or two of its many perte, iu the compens of one short poem. lt wiu be seen that
ester propcunding the whole subject in the shepe of s question to Maecenas, Horace
confines himself to one solution of it, and that, it must be admitted, not the most com-
prehensive (see notes on vv. 28. 108). Nor has he managed the connexion between his
question end the only anawei- he gives it with very great skill. Avarico is the ouly resson
he essigns for the universal discsse, end any one will see that· hereb] he leoves many un·
touched who ere ns culpably restless as the anticione, but not in their sordid way. How-
ever, when he is upon this subject he writes, ss he almost always does, with elegsnce end
truth, end this is among the most popular of Horeoe's Satires.

The chronologists atram e dete from the verses 114, 115 ς

“ Ut, quum monibus missos repit ungula currus,
Instat equis surige snos vincentibus, ——”

which are s little like the three last verses in the first Georgic of virgil ε

“ Ut, cum carceribus sese effudere, quadrigae
Addunt in spatia, et &usn-a retinacula tendens
Fertur equis surige, neque audit currus habenas.”

These verses Horace is said to heve imitated3 and es this Georgic is supposed to heve
been published mmo. 719, the Satire could not heve been written before thet year. But
even if 719 be correctly assigned ss the date of the first Georgia, which there are no suf-
ficient arguments to prove, it is not st all impossible thet the above verses ere imitated
by both pcets from some common original, as Orelli suggests. The likeness is not great.

The Setire is put first m the order of this book, not as su introduction es some say (of
which it beers no signs), but because it is addressed to Maecenas.
