tion (Sueten. vit. Aug. c. 59), and he also
was allowed ιο wear a god ring; that
is, he was made an ‘eques' (Dion Cass.
liii. 30. See S. ii. 7. 9, ιι.). Eusebius re·
lates that he lost his life by shipwreck.
Pliny (xix. 8. 38) says that Musa was called
in ιο su e Aemilius, the former phy-

sician, and that he successfully administered
lettuce to his patient, which the semp les
(⁸ nimia religio ') of Aemilius had refused
him. Comm. Cruq. qsays that the disorder
was gout, that Aemilius resorted ιο beating
remedies. going so far as to line the roof of
his bed-chamber with w0013 that Musa
came in and changed the whole treatment,

ordered not only cold baths, but gargles οξ
water from Atella (in Campania) and cold
drinks, by which means he soon cured him.

For this service he was presented, the
Scholiast goes on to say, with forty milliens
of sesterces b a senatus consultum. From
Dion (5³. 30} we learn that Musa attended
Marcellus. f so it is surprising that he
allowed him to go ιο Baiae, where Marcel-

lus died. Propertius says of the wetere,—

‘⁸ At nunc invisae magno cum crimine

Qtiisimdet}us in vestra constitit hostis

His ἶὲοῃέειιιι Stygias vultum demersit iu
Ειιιῗέἒῗίιι vestro spiritus ille lacu.”

The death of Marcellus may have contri-
buted ιο making Baiae unpopular for a
time, but it soon recovered its character

see above, Epp. 1. 83). There are some
iragments of medical works by Musa still

extant, aud he is fi-equently referred ιο as
an authority by Galen. The order of the

warm baths, 1 am being drenched with cold

to be Horace's meaning, and he gom on ιο

groves in which houses were emcted over
sulphur springs for vapour batha.

8. Qui caput et stomachum] A douche
bath on the head or stomach would now he
thought a strong remedy even by hydro-
pathists 3 but it is one os those which Musa
mcoipmended and Celsus likewise (i. 4 ς
ιν. 5 .

9. Clusinis Gabiosque] Clusium (Chiusi)
was one of the chief towns of Etruria, the
capital of Porsenna, and the place where
the Gauls received that insult which led ιο
their siege of Rome (Liv. v. 33). It was
situated on the Via Cassia, about loo mila
north of Rome. The river Clanis (ls
Chiana) flows by it, sonning nearly a com·
plete communication between the Arno sud
the Tiber. The Clusine marshes, which,
according to Tacitus (Anu-¹ ι. 79), it was st
one time proposed ιο drain into the Amo,
were formed by the overflowings of this
river. As ιο Gabii, see Ep. ll. 7, n. Pes

Romans went there. Strabo (v. 3 men· ,

The baths of Clusium may be those that
Tibullus refers ιο (iii. 5. 1)· -

whence the Via Campana went to Cumae
to the right, and the Via Aquilia went
straight on ιο Salernum, and the Appia
