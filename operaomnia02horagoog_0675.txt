650 HORATII FLAOGI

EPISTLE XX.

With this composition addressed to his book (which cen hardly be any other than this
collection of Epistles) Horace sends it forth to take its chmce iu the world. He arl-
dresses it ss a young audwunton melden engen· to θηρεῦσαι the mammantes her
home sud to rush into (langere she knows nothing of. He tells berit will be too hte to
repair her error when she 'discovers it; that she will be ceressed for a time and then
thrown away, and, when her youth end the fraehnoes of her boeuty are gone, she uin end
her days in misci-able drudgery md obscurity. He concludes with a desmiption of him-
self, his person, his character, and his ege. It is assumed with much confici-ee by
Franks that the Epistle was written on Horwe's birth-day, Bth December, A.u.c. 734, the
yetr aster that referred to st the end. 1 cannot discover on what grounds he nea& that
opinion, or why Horace writing on his forty-fiflzh birth-day should tell the world he was
forty-four the year before. (See note on v· 28.) He πει more likely to do so on my
other day than that.
