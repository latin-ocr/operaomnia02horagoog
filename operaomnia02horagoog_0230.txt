OARMEN XXVII.

The length of this ode is more imposing than the subject of it, which appears to be
s Journey to Greeoe (v. 19) proposed to be taken by s lady of Horaee’s acquaintance,
whom he pretends to deter from her purpose, by redting the danger! she will have to
eneounter and the fate that wuito upon female obstinacy, es munta-ntea by the story of
Europe, which story ooeupies two-thirds of the ode end thrusts Galatea end her journey
from the soene altogether. Ι do not see the difficulty of the ode that hus eri-ested most
of the editors. The length of the digression is simply-s wey with Horeoe (ns in the
story of Regulus, C. iii. 5, aud of Hypermnestre, iii. 11), end Pindar took the
same liberty with greater freedom. It is s peculim-ity which imitators of Honos will do
well to note, sor if skilfully managed it would relieve the temeuess of many en ode ‘which
professing to be en imitation of this author, hus little but his rhythm and a few of his
phrases to sustnin the resemblance.

By similu- arguments Propertius (i. 8) deters Cynthia from going to ses, snd Ovid
Curinus (Am. ii. 11). The Scholisst on Homer (11. xii. 307) says the story of Europe
was treated by Bacchylides, whose poem hns not eome down to us, nor any part of it, but
uns probably, ss Orelli says, in Horaee’s hands. The Scholiast’s aoeount os the story is
just that of the present ode. It would be difficolt to find s more touching picture thau
Horace has drawn of a young girl suddenly torn from her childish smusemeuts, truns-
ported fur from the security of her home, md left foi-lom among sti-angers, knowing no tie
but that of her father-’s love, to which she instinctively turns with longing end self-
reproeeh: her fsult had been giving way to e soolish impulse, but she sees her crime
through her fests, which magnify it greatly by pointing ιο its probsbIe issue, so that she
looks upon her idle curiosity as nothing less then msdness (v. 36). There is also great
skill in the lsst stamas, in which we heve, first, the derisive hughter with which Venus
end her son (whose bow is now unstrung because it has done its work, the Scholisst says)
break in upon the unhsppy girl 3 then the ironioel prophecy in which her own words are
used ngsinst hes-3 and, lestly, the serious consolation end congratulation with which they
announee her good fortune, end bid her rise to it. The pain srising from het eomplnint
is thus relieved, und we ure lofl: with the conviction that she is reconciled to her destiny

md proud of it.

ARGUMENT.

Let the wicked go on their wey with evil omens. 1 do but prey sor thee thet the stoi-m
may be evei-ted. Be happy go where thou wilt, end remember me, Gahtea. Fesr not
those idle omens: but see the rising stoi-m: I know the dangers it portende. May they
fall upon my enemy rethm- then on thee. It was thus Europa lest her girlish task sud
mssed the sen by night, but fehred not till she stood on the shore of Crete. Thon she
«ιι-ἰαί out in suguish, ⁴⁸ Ales! my father, e daughter’s name 1 heve abandoned3 love is
snllowed up in msdness. What an exchange is here! Many deaths do I deservo to
die. Am 1 swalna-,or is it e dream? Wesitbetter to cross theses than to gether young
flowers et home? Oh that I might avenge myself on thet monster once too dearly
loved. Shsme on me that I left my homeg shsme thet 1 delsy to die. Let me
go nsked among lions end perish by tigers, rather then waste away in e lingering death.
Vile girl, thy father uunts thee: why dost thou not die? Here thou msyest hang
hy thy gii-dle, or dash thee on the rocks, or into the stormy waves, unless thou
wouldest yield thyself a berberian's slave. '’—Then eume Venus and her son, and
hnghed mischievously, end said, “ Cesso thy wrsth when the monster shall come beck
