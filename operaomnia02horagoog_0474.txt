Discite, non inter lances mensasque nitentes

Cum stupet insanis acies fulgoribus et cum 5
Acclinis falsis animus meliora recusat,

Verum hic impransi mecum disquirite. Gur hoc?

4. inter lances mensasque nitentes] The
wealthy Romans had already learnt to fill
their rooms with costly furniture, and to
make a display of their plate, whether in
the shape of useful or ornamenta! vessels,
and the same fashion prevailed in the pro-
vinces, from whence in fact it must have
been imported. One of Cicero’s charges
against Verres (ii. 4. 16) is, that he robbed
one Diocles of all his plats, ‘⁴ ab hoc abac-i
vasa omnia, ut exposita fuerunt, abstulit.”
⁸ Exponere ' is the usual word for this dis-
play. ‘ Abaci’ were slabs usually of marble,
in later times even of silver. Their usewas
sometimes that of side-boards only. of
the same kind, used in the same way, were
the ⁴ Delphicae mensae’ mentioned in the
same oration of Cicero (c. 583 see Mr.
Long’s note). Very much of the plats thus
displayed was of foreign manufacture and
very costly, much of it of great antiquity,
and a good deal too taken from Greek and
Asiatic temples, and -brought to Rome by

- various conquerere (Marcellus and Mum-

mius in particular), by governors of Verres’
school, or by the travelling mercatores, who
thus brought home the proceeds of the
goods they took abroad. There appears to
have been no article in which the Romam
showed more extravagance than their tables ς
and, though this did not come to its height
till asper the time of Augustus, the text
shows that they were then very costlyg and
Pliny relates of Cicero that he gave a
million sesterces for a table of that sort
which were called ⁴ orbes! Theae consisted
of single slabs, v sometimes of great dia-
meter. Pliny (xiii. 15) mentions one made
cf the ‘citrus,' a tree of the cypress kind,
which was four feet in diameter. These
were called ‘ monopodia’ from their resting
on a single stem, usually of ivory. The
most expensive were spotted, and Pliny
calls them by various names expressive of
that appearance, ⁸ tigrinae,' ⁴ pantherinae,'
διο. See Becker's Gallus, Sc. ii. notes 9.
11. The wood next in value to the citrus
was the maple, and such an one Nasidienus
entertained his guests at (S. ii. 8. 10). The
dishes of the rich were very generally of
siber, so that the ⁴ lances ’ here mentioned
would be not only those which appeared

Leporem sectatus equove

upon the ‘ abaci,’ but those also in which
the viands were served. ⁴ Lances’ is here
used as a generic name for dishoeg but
there were other names, as ⁸ patina,' ‘ ea-
tinus,' ⁴ scutula,’ ⁴ gabata,’ ⁰ paropsis,’ all of
different shapes and for different uses.

9. cur-ruptusjudex.] Horace likens the
man whose judgment is biassed by a fine
table and good dinner to a judex who has
been tampsi-ed with. (See C. iv. 9. 39, n.)

— Leporem restatur equove] There is
some confusion raised in this long sentence
by the introduction of the words ⁶ pete ce-
dentem aera disco! Horace means at first
to say ‘⁴ when you have tired yourself with
hunting the hare, with riding an unbroke
horse, or (supposing the rougher sports are
too much for you) with hall play or throw-
ing the discus, and are dry and hungry,
then see if you will despise the commoneat
food, and call for rich mulsum.” Instead
of which he says: ‘⁶ aster hnnting the hare
or wearying your-sslf with riding, or if (sup-
posing you are only accustomed to Greek
sports, and the Roman are too much for
you) ball play occupies you or the discus,
then throw the discus3 but when satigue
shall have banished fastidiousness, and you
are dry and hungry, then see if '’ «Sic.
⁴ Romana militia ’ corresponds to what
Cicero says (de Nat. Deor. ii. 64): ‘⁴ exer-
ceamur 111 venando ad similitudinem bellicae
disciplinae.” · As may be seen by this
passage, the hall play, which was so common
an amusement in one shnpe or other among
the Romans, was introduced from Greece,
though the Romans had varieties perhaps
of their own invention. ΤῙιο most violent
form however, ‘ harpastum,’ was horrowed
from the Greeks, who also had the severer
exercise of sootball, which the Romans had
not. The throwing of the discus likewise
was of Greek origin, and belonged to the
heroic age. The nature of the discus is
seen in the famous statue of the δισκόβσλος
by Myron, of which casts are common, and
of which there is a good copy in the British
Museum. A wood-engraving of this statue,
and an account of the discus, will be found
in Smith’s Dict. Antt. The specimen of
Greek effeminacy mentioned in C. iii. 24.
57, the ‘trochus,' is more to the purpose
