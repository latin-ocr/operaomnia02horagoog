SATIRARUM I. 9. 417

SATIRE IX.. -

This Satire, which is justly popular for its humour and great dramatic power, has an
historical value as showing, undoeignedly but more clearly than almost any description
could do, the character os Horace. It puts the man before us as in a picture.

He represents himself as sauntering alone and early on the Sacra Via, when a person
he knew no more than by name, a forward coxcomb, comes up familiarly and falls into
conversation with him, to his great anuoyance, for he wanted to be alone and knew the
fellow’s character, which was probably notorious. Horace does his best to shake him off,
but he is too amiable to cope with the effrontery of his companiou, whose object is to
get through Horace an introduction to Maecenas, with whom the poet must therefore
have been known to be on terms of intimacy at the time this Satire was written. The
man's vulgarity and want of tect are conspicuous throughout the soene, as I have shown
in the notes3 while Horace exhibita in every part good breeding and an amiable temperg
and though he is tried to the utmost by reflectione on his patron and his friends, he is
incapable of saying a rude word, is taken off h'is guard continually, and is amusingly con..
scious of his inferiority to the man of insolence on his own ground. The effect of this
picture is heightened by the introduction towards the end of the scene of Fuscus Aristius,
au old friend of the poet, and a man of the world, who, like Horace, understood cha-
racter, but had that sort of moral courage and promptitudo which his friend wanted.
The readiness with which he takes up the joke and enters into Horace’s absurd position,
and the despair to which his desertion reduces the poet, are highly ludicrous.

If proof were wanting that the characters of men and the ways of the world are little
affected by the lapse of centur-ies, this Satire would afford it. 1 look upon it as the most
genial and characteristic of all Horace’s productione. If we wanted to form an estimato
of the man, 1 do not think we could go to any other part of his works with more likeli-
hood of getting a correct one; and his powers as a moral satir-ist are, 1 conceive, feeble
compared with his perception of, aud ability to describe, a scene of dramatic humour like
this. If he had left us only this amusing poem to judge by, his genius would.have
ranked high, and the goodness of his nature would have been acknowledged by all. Like
our amiable poet Cowper, Horace appears as a satirist of human life and of the vices of
society3 but both are too gentle for that rough work, and shine most in scenes of
quaint humour and inoffensive fun. As respecta Horace at least, let any one read this

Satira and judge for himself.

Isau sorte via Sacra, sicut meus est moe,
Nescio quid meditans nugarum, totus in illis:

 

l. Ibam sorte via Sacra,] Horace
does not mean that it was his custom to
simil on the Sacra Via, especially at that
bour in the morning, about eight o'clock
(v. 35) ς but that when he walked, his mind
generally diver-ted itself with trifles, being
of an easy turn, and having few anxieties
to trouble it. On the Via Sacra, see Epod.
iv. 7, n.; vii. 8, n. The reader whose ear
is accustomed to the expressive abruptness

who inserts ‘ut' aster ‘ibaml An Inm-
binus’ MSS. had ‘et’ before ⁴ totus.’ All
Cruquius’ but one were without ⁸ et.’
Those two editors insert the conjunction,
and some later editors do the same, in-
cluding Dacier and Gesner. Turnebus says
‘⁴ ¹ et ' legi in antiquis exemplaribus! Fea

of this opening will dissent from Bentley, junctiou.
