CARMEN XXII.

A.t1.0. '729 (ἓ). See note on v. 15.

Aristius Fuscus was an intimate friend of Horace’s, and the wag whom he represents
aa playing him false in his interview with the mubbeome fellow he met on the Sacra
Via (S. i. 9. 61). Horace and he were

 

‘⁶ paene gemelli,

Fraternis animis3 quiequid negat alter, et alten-3

Adnuimus pariter3 vetuli notique columbi ’' (Epp. i. lo).
We know nothing more of him except from the etatements of the Scholiasta, who make
out that he was a writer of tragediam another says of comediea, and all that he was a
grammarian. It hae aleo been doubted (from the confused statemente of the Scholiasta)
whether Horace is not the person meant S. i. 9. 22, which runs in all the MSS..—

“ Si bene me novi non Viscum pluris amicum

Non Varium fades.”
Itis impossible to determine the date of the ode. We can only say that it was written
aster Horace had got hie country-house, that ie, not earlier than Α.υ.ο. 722.
Fuscus, as usual, has not much to do with the ode, hie name being bon-<med as that
of Sentius (C. 4) and others, and for the same purpose.

ARGUMENT.

An honest man, Fuscus, may go unarmed along the burning shores of Africa, over the
wild Caucasus or to the fabulous Enat- ’Tum there, as 1 wandered car-elesa in the
woods einging οἰ my Lalage, a wolf such aa Apulia and Africa rear not met me and fied.
Set me in the eold end stormy north, or in the burning and uninhabited tropic, stin
will 1 love my smiling, prattling Lalage.
