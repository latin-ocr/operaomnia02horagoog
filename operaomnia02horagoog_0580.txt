Baieewae for several generations a favoni-ite
resort of the wealthy Romana. Julius
Caesar had a house there, and also Cn.
Pompeius. Martial, writing long aster
Horace, says (xi. 80)=

‘⁴ Ut mille landem, Flacco, versibus Baias,
laudabo digne non satis tamen Beine.”

Ita wan-m springs were a great ath-action.
Horace alludee ιο them in Epp. i, 15, where
he says the physician hes forbidden his
going ιο Baiae. The Lucrinus lacus was

up by the n'eing of the volcenic hill called
Monte Nuovo in the middle of the sixteenth
century. Teanum (now Teano) was a town

Latina, and about thirty mileo from Baiae.
Some very ancient coins with Oocen cha-

tice. ⁴ Vitiosa libido ' means ο, corrupt
caprimon· will, which is aeid ⁶ fecere euspi-
cium,’ to stand in tho place of birds end

enterprizee were undertaken.

87. Lectus yenialis in aula ech] ⁸ Aula'
means the ‘atrium3' and ‘lectus genialie‚’

site the door, was the marriage-bed, which
was dedicated ιο the genii of the bride and

‘⁴ Seu tamen adversm mutarit janue lectum,
Sederit et nostro cauta noverca toro,

Cogffigniam, pueri, laudate et ferte pater-

Gelliue (xvi. 9) quotes stom the compitalia
of Laberius:

‘⁴ anc talentu ee: nnnc tu sueque deque

Virgil'a line (Aen. vi. 603), ‘⁴ Lucent geniali-
bus altis Aurea fulcra toriass’ which is
usually quooed in this place, does not refer
ιο the marriage-bed, but ιο banquets in
honour of tbe genii, such as the Romane
celebrated on their birthdays and at other
times. (See C. iii. 17. 14.) The bed was
a symbol of domestic love and peace, and
was placed where it was for a good omen.

vetus eet-cami genium contemnere lecti‚”

mutat,’ Bentleius, ex conjectura inepta,'’
Fen says, and 1 agree with him, and so Ι

been the reading of one of the Scholiasta
(Comm. Cruq.), who says: ⁴⁴ fingit Maece-
natem ridere quasi praesentem.” But very
few MSS. have ⁴ rides,' end those inferior.
