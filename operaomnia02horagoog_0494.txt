against his slippery debtor Nerius. If thet
be so, the Stoic replies to him in ver. 74 end
the two following verses. The Scholiasta, it
is true, make Cicuta und Perilliue the same
pei-som but Acron adds, ⁴⁴ quidum dicunt
istum Nerium Perillium,'' und this is us
likely us the other, but more likely thet
they ere ell different. Tcking it so, the
senseseems to me to bethis. ’Μύκο ιιι
eutry of ten minue, or any thing else) lent
to Nerium d by wey of secui-ity, e hun-
dred such bonds ss Cicuta employs, und
to this any number of setta-e ou pleese
(that is, take what security ο him you
choose), still the rusoul will escape-⁸ To
which the Stoic replies, ‘ If he is mad who
ruins himself and cannot puy his debts, you
ure more med for lending him money which
you have no chance of getting buck again)
The bunker (‘srgenterius’) through whom
the money was advenoed would make un
entryin his books, which entry was legul
evidence of the debt3 but Per-illius ssys
with such u slippery fellow it would not be
sufficient. Porphyrion says, ‘⁴ juris verbo
scribom eet mutuum sumere.- reem-ibere,
restituere? And Bentley (on Epp. ii.
1. 105) says ‘scribe’ in this passage ie
addreesed to the debtor, quoting, among
other places, Dig. xii. l. 40, “ Lucius Titius
scripsi me ueeepieee e P. Muevio quindecim
mutue numeratu mihi de domo-'³ Thut
the word is used elsewhere in connexion
with the ueknowledgement given by the
borrower is true. It explains thst hens-
ection of the unjust stewsrd in the Gospel
of st. Luke (xvi. 6), δέξαι σου τὸ γράμμα
καὶ καθίσας faxim· γράψον πεντήκοντα.
But here it is impossible that the debtor
eun be addressed. The entry of the debt
must be meunt. Difficulties heve been
raised about ‘ deoem,’ after which Doering
und Heindorf, and most of the editors since
them including Orelli, propose to under-
stand ⁴ tubulas! This seems to me to spoil
the . ⁴ Decem ' ex the sum
lent, as ⁶ quindecim ' does in the above
passage from the Digest. And again, in
Dig. xlv. 2. 9, “Titius et Maevius Sem-
few enta ⁶¹¹¹ ιω ·· ³:³23

Kalendas manumittat, '⁹ und· elsewhere.
Acron und Porphyrion omit the preposition
before Nerio, us I heve done, but the latter
mys, ‘⁴ quidum Anerio legunt,” end this
means ⁸ u Nerio,’ which Comm- Cruq. has.
The Scholiest on Persius ii. 14 (“ Nerio jum
tertis conditur uxor ”), und Servius on Aen.
vii. 422, quote this passage without the

The olimst on Persius (l. c.) says thet
the Nerius there mentioned made a great
ded of money through the death of his
wives ⁴ und wne s notorious usurer, being
the sume thet Horace alludes to. 1 put no
fuith in this. The nume in either enee stende
for any body that the cnse may suit, though
it may heve become proverbial through some
poeson that bore it. ‘Cicuta' is e nicks
name, the Scholiasta say, given ιο some no·
torious usurer for his sour temper. Horace
represents him ss u sbrewd person to have
dealing-s with3 one who when he adveuced
money loolted well to the security, aud
when he bound a debtor tied the knot tight.
