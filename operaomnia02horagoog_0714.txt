Lento Samnites ad lumina prima duello·

dinners were gladiators who fought with
blunt weapons; ·and here the contestis said

came in. It was along trial of skill.

99. puncto illiue.- ·] ‘In his ¹iudgment
or by his vote! When an election took
place, there were certain persons called
⁴ custodes ' appointed to take the votes and
prick off the number given for esch candi·
date. From this process votes cametobe
called ⁴ puncta' See A. Ρ. 343, ιι.

101. Fit Mimnermus] See Epp. i. 6.
65, ιι. Horace seems to think him superior
to Callimachus, who Quintilian on the
other hand ssys⁴ ⁴elegiae princeps habetur-'⁹
(x. 1. 58). Hewasagrammarianand
voluminous prose writer as well as a poet, a
native of Cyrene, and established at Alex·

delphus and Euergetes, in the third century

——optt'vo] This word, signifying‘ desii-ed}
does not occur elsewhere. But it was εἶαρ
plied' ιιι later times to those⁴ tutores' “qui
ex optione sumerentur-f 'which is explained
on Epp. i. l. 21.

without sear of reprisals. Compare ⁴⁴ nobi·

lium scriptorum auditor et ultor,” Epp. i.
10. 39, where see note.

110. C'um tabulis animum censoris]
Dobree (Λᾶν. 406) thinks this may be imi-
tated from Demosthenes’ advice to the
δικασταὶ (de Cor. 298. 6), καὶ παρα·-
λαμβάνω γε ἅμα τη βακτηρίᾳ καὶ τῷ συμ-
βόλῳ τὸ φρόνημα τὸ τῆς πόλεως νομιζειν
ἕκαστον ὑμῶν δεῖ. The likeness of the
two passages is not great end only vei-hal.

113. Verba movere leem] The notion
of the censor is kept up. See note on S.
i. 6. 20.

114. Et vertentur adhuc] This is a
way of saying that the verses, though they
may be expunged, still are kept in the
author-'s desk, because he has a regard for
them and cannot make up his mind to
desti-oy them. Porphyrion explains⁴ pene-
tralia Vestae ¹ thus. “Id est, domi, ‘per
quam metaphoram ostendit, quae in animo
nostro fixe versentur, tamen excludenda
esse.” The san of Vesta could only
be entered by her own priestesses-

116. speciosa vocabula Ναυῆ] ‘Ex-
pressive terms ς’ words which make them-
selves intelligible at onoez “quae prima
specie probantur ’⁹ (Foreell.). So in A. P.
319 a play is said to be ‘speciosa locis‚’
that is ⁴ plain in its points‚' itsoemmon-plaoes
or sentiments clearly put.
