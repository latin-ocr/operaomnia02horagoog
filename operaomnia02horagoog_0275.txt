HORATII F LAOOI

Dicunt in tenero gramine pinguium

Custodes ovium carmina fistula,

Delectantque deum cui pecus et nigri
Colles Arcadiae placent.

Adduxere sitim tempora, virgili ς

Sed pressum Calibus ducere Liberum

Si gestis, juvenum nobilium chene,
Nar-do vina merebere.

Nardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum

Qui nunc Sulpiciis accubat horreis,

Spes donare novas largus amaraque
Gurarum eluere efficax.

Ad quae si properas gaudia, cum tua.

Velox merce veni: non ego te meis

Immunem meditor tingere poculiS,
Plena dives ut in domo.

Philomela into the swallow, and Procne, the
mother of Itys, into the nightingale. A
third version makes Philomela the mother
of Itys. See Hom. (Odyss. xix. 518)=

In short the legend is more varied than al-
most any other. I have already had occa-
sion ιο observo how little accuracy was
studied by the poets on such matters (C. iii.
