certain stom that passage that he still
retained thaee duties. ΤῙιο Scholiasts give
other conjectures respecting this allusion to
Tarpa, but the above seems to be the true
explanation. The meaning of ' ‘ aede'
cannot be so readily determined. Comm.
(Ἆπις. says it was “ Aedes Apollinis seu
Musarum,'' and Bentley on Epp. ii. 2. 92,
says it was either the library attached to the
Palatine temple of Apollo, or the temple
called ⁴ Hermlis Musarum,' rebuilt by
Philip, the step-father of Augustus, and
called from him ‘ Porticus Philippi. But the
former temple was not built fin the autmnn
of afloc. 726. (C. i. 31. Int). The latter

erected to the Muses by milvius Nobilior,
about A.u.c. ⁶75. Temples of Apollo and
the Muses are referred to by Juvenal (S. vii.

no doubt that other temples besides (see
Ovid. Trist- iii. l. 69) had buildings at·
tached where men of Ietta-s assembled. In
one of these, therefore, or some building
especially conseoeated to the Muses (for
‘mdes’ in the singular number mnnot sig-
nify a private house, nor does the context
admit of that interpretation, which Masson,
Franke, and others give it) poets who had
plays they wished to getreprese nted recited

Fundanius, who Horace says was the only
man of the day who could write a eomedy
in the style of Menander and that school,
nothing whatever is known, and conjectures
are useless. Because he is mentioned with
Pollio, who gave up arms for letters,
Weichert (Poet. Lat. p. 51, ιι. 41) conjec-
. tures he may have been C. Fundanius, an
eques who, we are informed by the author
of the Bellum Hispanicum (c. ll) desei-ted
Sext. Pompeius and went over to Aug-ustus
(see Diot. BiogL). But this is not a very

good argument. He is mentioned with
Pollio because the one wrote comedies and
the other tragedies. Fundanius is the
narrator of the scene in S. ii. 8, the supper
of Nasidienus. 1 think it probable Horace
exaggerated his merite as well as Pollio's
out of affection for the men. As to Pollio,
see C. ii. l. lut„ and v. lo, ιι. “ Pollio's
political greatness might easily dazzle the
eyes of his contemporaries as to the true
value of his politica! works,” is Schlegel’s
opinion (Drama, Lect- viii..) and he thinks
that though⁴ ‘we cannot exactly oetimate
the extent of our loss (in the nagedies of the
Augustan age)toall appearanceitisnot
extraordinarily greatss' ⁴ ,' such as
the ‘saoeal’elopis domus' ἔθ’ i. 6. 8, n..)
‘Pede ter percusso’ refers to the nimeten-
iambic, the common measure of nagedy.
As to Varius, see the ode last mentioned,

significatione of‘ duoere’ are so various, as
obser-ved before (C. iv. 6. 2), that it is hard
to follow them. As applied to a poem it is
snppoffl by some to be taken from the pro-
oess of spinning, which receives support
“ tenui deducta

from Epp. ii. l. 225:
“Mille die

Scholiasta say that virgil appears to have
written the ‘os and Bucolics3 but
they only gether this probably from the
text. Tho Bucolics had been published
some time, end they seem to have been well
