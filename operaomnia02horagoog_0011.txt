x PREFAOE.

that appeared to have originated from himself, I have given his
name. Where on the other hand, as is the case very often, the
quotation is only one of the common stock that has accumulated

from the Scholiasta downwards, I have given credit for it to no one,
but do not on that account wish to have the credit of it myself.

If any have been suggested by my own memory or reading, I have
not inquit-ed whether others had thought of them before, and shall
hope that Ι may not appear to have defrauded any one. I have
been careful as far as possible to let Horace illustrate himself,
without however distracting the reader by referring him backwards
and forwards to passages that will throw no light upon the text.

The MSS. generally and most of the editions have inscriptions
or headings to the different poenis. That these were not given
them by Horace himself is clear, but they appear in the earliest
MSS.‚ and are supposed by some to have been invented by the
grammarians almost contemporary with the author. They vary
very much in the different MSS.‚ and as they are quite arbitrary
modern editors have seen the propriety of abandoning them. At
the same time, as Kirchner says justly enough (Qu. Hor. p. 20),

they have their value as showing the opinion of very early gram-
marians as to the scope of the different poems‚ and 1 have accord-

ingly referred to them where they could be of· any use in settling
disputed points.

Ι had supposed before I began that much that now appears in
the notes might be omitted ΒΥ merely referring the reader to the

Dictionaries of Antiquities and Biography edited by Dr. Smith.
But valuable as those works are, Ι found that the articles were not

and could not be so drawn up as to save the necessity, in many

instanceS, of independent notes in such a commentary and for
such an author as this. I have often referred to them, and if
Ι ought to have done so oftener the omission has been uninten-

tional.
