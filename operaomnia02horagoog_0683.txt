658 HORATII FLAOGI

J urendasque tuum per nomen ponimus aras,
Nil oriturum aliae, nil ortum tale fatentes·

Sed tuus hic populus», sapiens et justus in uno,

Te nostris ducibuS, te Graiis anteferendo,

Cetera nequaquam simili ratione modoque 20
Aestimat, et nisi quae terris semota suisque

Temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit ς

Sic fautor veterum ut tabulae peccare vetantes

Quas bis quinque viri sanxerunt, foedera regum

is confirmed in part by Tiberius (Anu. iv.
38):⁴ ‘Optimos quippe mortalium altissime
cupere. Sic Herculem et Liberum apud
Graecos, Quirinum apud nos deum numero
ndditos. Melius Aug ustum qui speraverim

During his life he desii-ed to be accounted
the son of Apollo, and was represented on
coins in the character of that god phying

on a harp3 and Acron (on Epp. i. 3. 17)
says he set up a statue of himself' ιιι the

libi-ary on the Palatino in the dress md
likeness of Apollo. There' is also a coin in
Potini’ e collection representing him with
Jove's ‘fulmem’ But it may be assumed
that he was not worshipped in the city till
he was dead (when several temples were
erecwd to him. and his worship wss regu—
larly established) and that the altar-s Ho-
race speaks· of were those which were raised
in the provinces, like that below.

16. Jurandasque tuum per· nomen] The
oldest Blendinisn MS. end ο very few others
heve‘ numen, 'which Bentley defends in
his usual manner. 4 Nomen ' is the reading
of nll·editions before his, and of mont since.
He would also alter the text in Tac. (Anu.
i. 73), where it is said ‘⁴ Rubrio crimini
dabatur violatum perjurio nomen Augustil'
He also quotes ιιιι ulter inscription (Gruter,
Ρ. 229):⁸ ‘Numici Augusti votum susceptum
ι plebe Narbonensium in perpetuumss' the

date of which wss A. u ..c 764, while Au·
gustus was alive. Horace uses‘ numen' in

C. iv. 5. 35. “et Laribus tuum Miscebit
numen, ” end Ovid constantly uses it in
the wey of flattery. There cen be no doubt
Horace might have written ‘ numen ' here,
but 1 do not see why he should not bave
said ‘ nomen‚’ or why nearly all the copyists
should have substituted the latter less likely
word for the other, both in this place und
that of Tacitus above. The person who
ewore by the altar leid his hand upon it end
invoked the name of the divinity to whom
it was consecrated. This act is represented
on ει gem in Gorlscus' collection, pert ii.

17. Nil oriturum aliam] This is ο re-
petition osc, iv. 2. 37:

“Quo nihil majus meliusve terris

Fata donavere bonique divi

third time Horace uses this combination-
See S. ii. 3. 266. 271.

23. Sic fautor veter-unu] Suetonius,
commending the simplicity of Aumm¹
style of laugssge (c. 86), addae “Qeoeeloe

He would therefore, esox-elli asthopie-ed
with thece remarks of Horace.
