He calls them “legum fontes et capita?

24. foedera requiri] The cunning way
in which Sex. Tarquinius got possession of
Gabii for his father Tarquinius Superbus is
related br Livy (i. 53, sq.). Dionysius
Halicarn. (iv. 58) says he had read sn in-
scription on s shield covered with the hide of
an ox sacrificed on the occasion sud hung up
in the temple of Zeus Fidius at Rome, which
inscription contained the terms of a treaty
between Tarquinius and the people of Gabii
(respecting which place see Epp. i. 11. 7, ιι.).
The terme he says were favourable; the
langusge wss archaic, ἀσπὶς-γράμμασιν
ἀρχαῖκοῖς ἐπιγεγραμμένη. Niebuhr says
the two storias are not compatible‚ and he
does not believe Livy’s. Gabiis and Sa-

·binis areboth governed by ‘cum.' Com· Ρ

‘⁶ The strictness oyf their mbralsghnd their
cheerful contentedness were the peculiar
glory of the Sabellian mountaineers, but
espedslly of the· Sebines snd the four
northern cantone, and they preserved it
long ester the virtues of ancient times had
dissppeared at Rome from the hearts snd

the demeauour of men. The Sabines were prop

simple-hearted and honest.'’ The contrast
between them end the men of Rome in his
own time is described by Horace in C. iii.
6. 37, sqq. See also Epod. ii. 41=

‘⁴ Sabino qualis aut perusta solibus
Pernicis uror Apuli ;”

and the description of his Sabine neigh-
bours (S. ii. 6.; Epp. i. 14. 3). The treaty
Horace alludes to msy be that between
Romulus and Tatius, by which the two
natione became one (Livy i. 13).

⁶ Aequatus‚’ in this sense of tresties or
agreeneilesizts 1:nude on equal terms, does not
occur w ere.
’ 26. Pontificum libum] These are men·
tioned, by Cicero in the place quoted above.
The college of Pontiffs hed books contain-
ing the regulations by which they were
guided, and all matters pertnining to their
office, and the worship of the gods, the
general super-vision of which was their'prin-

cipal duty. The original books were, sc-

cording ιο mitiori, given to them by Numa
at their first creation; bnt they were added
to from time to time, and they must have
been numerous when Horace wrote. Some
parts were no doubt very entiqusted in ex-
pression and idem.

26. muoso volumina valven] Suetonius
says ofA stus (c. 31) thst aster he be-
came Poniig} Maximus, ⁴⁴ quicquid fatidi-
corum librorum Graeci Latinique generis,
nullis vel parum idoneis auctoribus vulgo
ferebatur, supra duo millis contracta undi-
que cremavit3 ac solos retinuit Sibyllinos:
hos qnoque delectu habito; condiditque
duobus forulis auratis sub Palsfini Apollinis
basi.”⁹ Augustus did not succeed to the
sbove office till after the death of Lepidus
in Asnc. 741. Porphyrion explains the
‘ volumina ⁹ ss those ‘⁴ veteris Martii vatis,
snt Sibyllne.” The ¹ carmins’ of Mardus,
or the Marcii, were old writings in a pro-
hetic sti-ain and half metrical form, of
which Livy has quoted two specimens (xxv.
12), but not apparently with all their
archaisms complete. According ιο Sueto-
nius, Augustus burnt all books of this sort
except the ‘ Sibyllini libri: as they were
called, which were written in Greek. But
Servius (on Aen. vi. 72) says that along
with these books were preserved the poems
of Marcius. Other prophetie books were
kept in the capitol, such as “ the Etruscan
hedes of the nymph Bygoe; those of
Albuna or Albunea of Tibur (C. i. 2. 12),
and who knows how many others of the
same sort? These were all books of fate,
and every Etruscan city seems ιο have pos-
sessed such '¹ (Niebuhr i. 507). Niebuhr
(i. 259, n.) thinks ths't Horace may be allud-

history of the Roman kings hes been forged,

the Marcii. which Niebuhr says, “in spite
of his contemptuous glauce at them, were
extremely poetical. of this,” says be, “ we
