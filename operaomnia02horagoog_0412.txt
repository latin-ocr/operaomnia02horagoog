ancient ruins may be tnced fragments of
aquaeducto. tombs, amphitheatres, batha,
military columns, aud two triumphal arches.
’ sse present town stands on a height where
the citadel stood, and contains not above
³00 houses. ‘⁸ The medals of Canusium
in silvei· and bronze have the inscriptions
ΚΔ. ΚΑΝΥ. ΚΑΝΥΣΓΝΩΝ, with a head
of Hercules on a vase aud clusters of
grapes” (Cramer, Italy, ii. p. 292, n.).
A supply of good water was brought into
this town by Hadrian the emperor. That
Apulia was not well watered has been
observed before (Epod. iii. 16, n.). The
turbid waters os the Aufidus must have
been unfit for drinking. The bread of Ca-
nosa seems to be as bad as ever„ Swin-
burne writes (i. 166) ι “We breakfasted at
an inu near the bridge, and regretted our
not having followed Horace's example in
bringing a supply of bread from some other
place, for what we got here was as brown as
mahogany, and so gritty that it set our teeth
ou edge to crunch it. The friable incom-
passclt: οοῃωξῑὲιτῖδοξ the stone {geth vgich {ge
m ers eir corn ra r an e
sand of {hl} area where ’it is iredden out,
can alone have perpetuated this defect in
the Canusian breed for uineteen centur-ies.
1 believe these millstones are of the eost
concreted rock, which constitutos the greater
part of their coast.”

make ‘ditior’ agree with ‘locus,' ‘which
place, being not richer in water (than the
last) by a single pitcher, was built by brave
Diomed.' so Orelli takes it. The construc-
tion is not very agreeableg but to avoid it
we must suppose great irregularity. Bentley
makes ‘ urna ’ the nominative, and ‘ ditior '
to agree with it in the sense of ⁴ uberior!
He strikes out the next verse as unmeaning
and unworthy of Horace.

93. Varius] See above, v. 4⁰, n.

94. Rubos] This town of the Peucetii
retains its name under the form Ruvo, and
was thirty miles from Canusium. The
medalu found at Ruvo have the inem-iptions
ΡΥ. ΡΥΒΑ. m. ΡΥΒΔΣΤΕΙΝΩΝ. They
have also a head of Minerva or Jove, and

on the reverse an owl on a branch. The
mad from Canusium was calledVia Egnatia,
from the town it led to. Swinburne (i. 400)
describes the remains of it for twelve miles
from Canosa as paved with common rough
pebbles, and passing over a pleasant down.
Half way between Canusium and Rubi the
Jerusalem Itinerary mentions a place which
it calls ‘ad Quindecimum: and which is
now identified with Castel del Monte.

96. ad usque] See S. i. l. 97, n.

97. Bari moenia piscosi ,-] Barium still
retains its name Bari, occupying a rocky
peninsula of a triangular form about a mile
in circumfer-enee. It was an important town
on the coast, and a municipium. Its dis-
tance from Rubi was twenty-two miles, ‘⁶ a
most disagreeable stony road through a vine

Brass coins have been discovered at Bari,
bearing, on one side a head of Jupiter
erowned with laurei, ou the other a figure
of Cupid seated at the prow of a vessel, aud
shooting an arrow, with the inscription
ΒΑΡΙΝΩΝ. Others with a head of Jupiter

and the prow of a vessel and the inscription ’

BAPI. Others again with a head of Pallas,
and a ship, aud Cupid crowning a trophy.
There must have been a harbour, it would
be thought, to receive the galleys which,
from the above coins, it is evideut this
place possessed. But there is scarcely any
now. See Swinburne, who writes (i. 191),
“ a plentiful fish supper was provided by
our kind host (the Prior of a Dominican
convent), anxious to support the reputation
os Bari in that article. The abundauce and
delicacy of the fish vouch for Horace 's
knowledge of the peculiar excellencies of
his own country.”

Gnatia] This was perhaps the local
way of pronouncing Egnatia. Itwas another
sea-port town, and thirty-seven miles stom
Barium. Between them lay formerly, ac-
cording to the Itineraries, two small forta
called Turris J uliana (Terre Pellosa) and
Turris Aureliana (Ripagnola),the first eleven
milas and the second twenty miles from
Barium. Of Egnatia nothing important is
recorded. Its ruins are still iu existence
