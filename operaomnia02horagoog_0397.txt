phyrion). “qu us amicus erat‚⁹ adds
Cruquius⁹ Scholiast, who says he was called
Capitolinus from his imputezl offence. But
this was probably a cognomen of the Pe-
tillia gens. Lambinus mentions having
seen at Rome a silver coin, having on the
reverse a representation of the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus, and the name of Petil-
lius. On the obverse was J upiter's head
with Capitolinus round it. Such a coin is

crown is very likely to have been invented.
That he was tried on some serious charge
and acquitted, and that the verdict did not
escape wandel, is clear stom the context.
See also 8. 10. 26. The nature of the ac-
cusation, notwithstanding the predae story
of the Scholiasta, must remain a matter of
doubt. We may also gether that he was a
person os influence from v. 97, which he
must have been if he was acquitted, or sup-
posed to have been acquitted‚ through the
corruption of the' Jury. There' is sarcasm in
‘sed tamen admiror, ⁹ ἔω.. which Horace
calls‘ succus loliginisss the dark secretiori of
the cuttle- fish, black and malignant-

‘Aerugo mera‚⁹ nothing but copper- -rust
that eats into character and destroys it.
Compare Martial (x. 33. 5):--

“Ut tu, si viridi tinctos aerugine versus
Forte malus livor dixerit esse meos,
Ut sacis, a nobis abigas.⁹⁹

102. ut σι· quid] There is a little ob·
scurity in the construction, but the sense is
plain. 4 1 promise, as 1 truly can, if 1 can

promise of myself aught else with truth!

‘Pi-omitto, ut vere possum si aliud quid vere
de me promittere possum!

as this’ — ‘'hoc Jus 'would not do.

4 Suesco ⁹ and its compounds have an active
as well as a neuter signification, taking
usually an accusative os the person and
dative of the thing, which order is inverted
in Virg. (Aen. vi. 833), 44 Ne, pueri, ne
tanta animis assuescite bella.’⁹ See Porcel-
lini for examples, and below, S. ii. 21⁰9·

“Pluribus assuerit mentem corpusque super-
bum. ⁹⁹ 1 am not aware of any instances of
a double accusative after‘ suesco⁹ except
this, and 1 do not know why Horace should
have written· 4 hoc ⁹ instead of 4 huic,⁹ or

‘me ⁹ instead of ‘mi,⁹ like Virgil’s construc-
tion above. Lambinus alters the received
reading into ‘insevit pater optimus hoc
mi,' and for ‘insevit' there is some MS.
authority. But it is not likely to be the
right word here. Is any alteration were
made I*should prefer leaving 4 insuevit ⁹ and
altering ‘me.⁹ 1f ‘me‘ is retained, the
construction is that of the Greeks, who
said ἐθίζειν ri τινα. Bentley ia clearly
wrong in rendering ‘hoc’ with ‘fugerem.’
Its position is against that construction, and
moreover it gives no sense. Orelli applies
‘notando’ to Horace himself. ‘My excellent
father accustomed me to this, that 1 should
avoid, by means of. examples, each particular
vice by noting it (as it came before me) ς’
but‘ notando⁹ seems to have more of the
technical sense, and applies to the father,
who taught his son to avoid vices, by brand-
ing them in each instance by means of ex-
amples. SeeS. i. 6. 14, ιι., ou ‘notarel
