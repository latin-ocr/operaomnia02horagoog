PREFAOE. xi

I meant at first to give an Index of the prinoipal words to form
a Concordanoe at the end of the Volume3 but Ι found there was no
room for it, and I hope that, as I have made the Index to the
notes pretty copiouS, and have given a full Index of Proper Names

expressed or referred to in the text, the want of the other Index
will not be much felt.

I had hoped it would be possible to give engravings of -a few
coine, medule, vasen, sve„ to illustrate various allusions; but the
Publishers are anxious to keep the price of the work as moderate
as they ean, and the engravings have therefore been omitted.
