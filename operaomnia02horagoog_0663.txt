HORATII FLACOI ’

Ut puerum saevo credas dictata magistro

Reddere vel partes mimum tractare secundas,

Alter rixatur de lana saepe caprina, 15
Propugnat nugis armatus: “ Scilicet ut non

Sit mihi prima fides, et vere quod placet ut non

Acriter elatrem !

Pretium aetas altera sordet.''

Ambigitur quid enim? Castor sciat an Dolichos plus;
Brundisium Minuci melius via ducat an Appi. πο

14. parter mimum tractare secundam]
⁶ Secundae agere ' ia a phrase taken from
the stage. On the Greek stage there were
only three actore, who were called πρωτα·
γωνιστὴς, δευτεραγωνιστής, τριταγωνισ-
τὴςτοψοοῆνώγ. (see A.P.192,n.). Inthe
Roman playa and ⁴ mimee' there was no euch
specific distinction3 but aa on our own
stage there ia always one principal actor
that takes the lead, while the rest act paru
more or lena subordinate, eo it was with the
Romanu and ⁴ secundas agere,’ though it
sometimes applied to a particular actor
if there were any more prominent than
the rest, was applied to all exce t the
chief, especially in the mimea, whi oon·
aiated chiefly of dumb ehow, and in which
the inferior parte were all arranged, and
the actore played, eo aa to support the

tius quotes the following story from Sue-
tonius (Calig. 57), which illustrate· thie,
and shows that ‘secundae ’ waa applied to
the inferior parte generally: “ Cum in

'rho subordinatas were also called ‘ adju-
tores! (See S. i. 0. 46. n.)

. 15. de lana saepe caprinam] Thia ia
plainly equivalent to ‘ nothing at all! The
Greek proverb corresponding to this, and
usually quoted in thie place, is περὶ ὄνου
σκιᾶς μάχεσθαι, founded upon a story told
in court, according to the Scholiast on
Aristophanen (Veep. 131), by Demosthenes.
A man hired an ase, ond in the beat of the
day lay down in the shadow of the animal,
whereupon the owner turned him out of
hia place, eaying he had hired the aee, but
¹unct his shadow3 and on this they went to
