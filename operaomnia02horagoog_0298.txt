EPODON LIBER, 2. 273

GARMEN ΙΙ.

Horace, meaning to write on the praises of the country, put his poem (whether as an
aster—thought or not may be open to conjecture) into the shape of a rhapsody by a money-
getting usurer who, aiter reciting the blessings of a country life and sighing for the enjoy-
ment of them, resolving to throw up his business and persuading himself that he desires
nothing so much as retirement and a humble life, finds habit too strong for him and falls
back upon the sordid pursuits which aster all are most congenial to him. Some may
perhaps think that this little bit of satire is the chief object for which the poem was
written. My impression is that it was commenced (whether in imitation of virgil, Georg.
ii. 458, sqq„ as Franke supposes, οι· of some poem of Archilochus as Lachmann, or not
in imitation of any thing which is more probable) as a “laudatio vitae rusticae'' (which is
the tenor of most of the inscriptions), and that the last four verses, which have been called
clumsy, were added to give the rest a moral. At any rate the greater part of the speech
must be admitted to be rather out of keeping with the supposed speaker. We should not
expect, for instance, to hear a city usurer talk about an hereditary farm, the dangers of
the soldier and the ssilor, and the cares of love. The last difficulty is got rid of by Doering
and others, who interpret ‘ amor ’ (v. 37) as the love of money, which that editor says
‘⁸ vix dubitari potest,” though the word ⁴ habendi ’ ‘⁴ paulo licentius omisit.” This 1
am quite sure is wrong3 and 1 think we must allow that Horace was more intent upon
his description than on maintaining an accurate consistency between the circumstances of
the speaker and the sentimenta he utters. But, however this may be, the picture is very
beautiful and the moral very true. In the most sordid minds more geuial impulsos will
sometimes ariae = but the beauties of nature and the chax-ms of a peaceful retirement are,
like virtue itself‚ only attractive in the distance and at inter-vals to minds that have grown
addicted to the pursuit of gain for its own sake. To such minds domestic and innocent
pleasures offer no lasting gratificafion, and the picture of rustic enjoyment on the one
hand, and of the jaded but still grasping usurer struggling for a moment against his
propensities on the other, affords a wholesome lesson for many. In respect to the date,
it can only be conjectured that Horace had tested the enjoyments he describes so graphi-
cally, and was in possession of his farm. But even that is uncertain. Franke, thinking
that Horace must have had before him Virgil’s second Georgic (458. sqq.), which some say
was not published till mmo. 724, attributes this ode to 72⁴¹ also, in which his friend
Lachmann informs him he seems ‘⁸ nimis subtiliter ignorabilia rimatus esse.’' There is
a stag-ment from the comedy Νῆσοι attributed to Aristophanes (344, Dind.), which is
very like this ode. Whether Horace ever saw it or thought of it when he was writing it
is impossible to say. It runs thus :—

ὦ μῶρε μῶρε, ταῦτα πάντ’ ἐν τῇδ’ ἔνι·
οἰκεῖν μὲν ἐν ἀγρῷ τοῦτον ἐν τῷ γηδίῳ
ἀπαλλαγέντα τῶν κατ’ ἀγορὰν πραγμάτων,
κεκτημένον ζευγάριον οἰκεῖον βοοῖν.

ἔπειτ’ ἀκούειν προβατίων βληχωμένων
τρυγός τε φωνὴν είς λεκάνην ὠθουμὲνης,
ὄψῳ τὲ χρῆσθαι σπινιδίοις τε καὶ κίχλαις
καὶ μὴ περιμένειν ἐξ ἀγορᾶς ἰχθύδια
τριταῑα, πολυτίμητα, βεβασανισμένα

ὄπ’ ἰχθυοπώλου χειρὶ παρανομωτὰτῃ.
