12 HORATII FLAOGI

Sive mutata juvenem figura
Ales in terris imitaris, almae
Filius Maiae, patiens vocari

Caesaris ultor:

Serus in caelum redeas diuque 45
Laetus intersis populo Quirini ;
Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum

Ocior aura

Tollat: hic magnos potius triumphOS,
Hic ames diei pater atque princepe, 50
Neu sinas Medos equitare inultos

Te duce, Caesar.

though he was forty years old st this fime-
So Virg. (G. i. 500) 2—
“ Hunc saltem everso ,iuvenem succurrere

saeclo
Ne prohibete.’'

‘ J uvenis ' end ⁸ adolescens’ were used for
any age between ‘ pueritiis ' und ⁴ senectus!
Cicero speaks of himself as ¹ adolescens ¹ at
the time he put down Catiline's conspiracy,
when he was forty-four years old, and as
⁴ senex ’ when he delivered his 2nd Philippic‚
st which time he was aixty-two. “ Defendi
Rempublicem adolescens non deseram se-
nex ' (Phil. ii. 46). But the reader will
find many examples in Forcellini‚ under the
articles ⁸ adolescens’ and ⁶ juvenis!

43. patiens vocari] AGruecism. “Patiar-
que vel inconsultus haberi,” Epp. i. 5. 15.
“ Cum pateris sapiens emendatusque vocari ”

E . i. 16. 30 .

( ff. Caesaris)ultor:] Estre, a very dili-
gent scholar and candid man, declares him·
self perfectly unable to account for this
langue-ge of Horace. It confounds and
disturbs he says all his notions of Horace’s
character (Pronop. p. 277). See Introduc-
tion to this ode. ⁴ Alter ’ has been stupidly
proposed to meet these objections.

45. Serus in caelum redeas] ovid, Met.
XV. 868, sq. z—

“ Tarde sit ills dies et nostro serior aevo
Qua. caput Augustum quem temperat
orbe relicto
Accedat caelest

See also Trist. v. 2. 47. The adjective for
the adverb is- com‘mon in respect of time.
The instances in Horace ere very nume-
rous.

46. populo Quirini 5] Some MSS. have
Quirino. But the genitive is the general
reading, end corresponds more closely to

ἕπε regular form ⁸ populus Romanus Quiri-
um.

49. triumphem] Augustus hed just cele-
brated, or was just about to celebrate, three
triumphs on three successive days, for his
victories (1) over the Pannonians aud Dal-
manans, (2) at Actium, and (3) at Alex-
andria. ‘Triumphos’ is governed by ‘ames‚’
as ‘ pocula’ is governed by ⁶ spernit ⁹ (i. 1.
19) ς in both which cases we have an sccu-
sative cese and sn infinitive mood governed
by the same verb.

50. pater] The fitle of ⁴ pater patriae ⁹
was not assumed by Augustus till A.u.c.
752. Ovid addi-esses him by that title,
(Fast. ii. 127) :—

“ Sancte peter patriae, tibi plebs, tibi curia
112²? :fflit ς hoc dedimus noa tibi nomen
eques.

Res temen ente dedit. Sero quoque vera
Nffliigl: ε jampridem tu peter orbis eras.
Hoc tu per terras quod in aethere Jupiter
N÷t511mhabes3 hominum tu peter, ille

It was the highest title of honour that
could be conferi-ed on a citizen, and was
first given by the Senate to Cicero (the
army had formerly bestowed it on Camil·
lus), on the occasion of his suppressing
Catiline’s conspiracy. Juv. viii. 243 :—

“ Roma. parentem—,

an‘pixpgffem peti-iae Ciceronem libera
where ‘libera' seems to mean that the
senate were no longer free agents when
{izai-stus took the name. See C. iii. 24.
