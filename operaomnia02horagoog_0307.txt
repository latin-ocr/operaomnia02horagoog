HORATII FLAGGI

unanimous statement of the Scholiastn and though it must be admitted thet, without
their authority, no ingenuity would have discovered that Menas was the subject of the
Epode, und notwithstanding the appear-nce of another mmo the forgery of which it is
difficult to account for, in one or two inm-iptions‚ it does not seem that ιι cese has been
made out against thet which until recently hes been the opinion generally received ou the
authority of the Scholiasta. The MSS. with inscriptions bearing the nme of Vedius m
four in number: one of Kirchner’s best is inscribed ‘⁴ nd quendem tribunum inimicum
poetue;'' which title anyonewould nemi-ellynffix to the poemwho hed uoclnetothe
person intended but such as itselt ufforde. But the vast majority of MSS.. of which Fe·
hes cited a luge number, ere headed with inscriptions to the effect thet Mene· is the
person ettecked, though the copyists hed so little respect for these titles thet they were
content to nke merely the substance of them, since no two MSS. encuy evoe in the
words. 1 need not repeat thet none of the inscriptions ceu with any probability be sup-
posed to heve been effixed by Horace himself.
