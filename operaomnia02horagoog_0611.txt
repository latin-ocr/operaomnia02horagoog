ARGUMENT.

1 promised to be beck iu a few days, end now 1 have been a whole mouth any. But
you let me go beeeuse 1 was sick, and now γοα will excuse me, 1 know, if 1 am ufru‘d
of this fatal seuson. And when the snow shall show iteelf on the fields of Alba, 1 shall
go to the see const end take cere of myself, with my books, end return, deur ffiemL
with your permission, with the return of the mllow. Youn was not the liberality of the
unmsnnerly Calabriae, who preesed his pen-s upon his guest, und when he still politely
declined‚ eoneluded with “ us you plesse: if you do not eet them the pige vill-'⁹ The
spendthrift gives away what he does not eure fon—e. generosity that does but breed
ingratitude. The good mm gives to those who desei-ve, but he known the velue of
money. 1 then will try und be deserving·in proportion to the goodness of my bene-
fucwr. But if γοα will heve me always live et Rome, give me beck the strength and
cheerfulness of my youth.

A little fox chaneed to get through e ‹n-enny into s veesel of eom, and when he hed men
his fill tried to get out, but eould not. ‘⁴ Lean you went in end to lemnes· γοα must
return if you would get out,'' aeid s weusel hurd by. If any one says the sume to me,
1 qn ready to give up all. 1 dou’t prsise the repose und freedom of the country only
beeuuse Ι have my belly full of dainties. Ι would not exchenge it for the weulth of
Arabia. You heve osten witnessed end commended my revel-enee for you, end have
heard me eell γοα my father end my king; but see if 1 eennot eheerfnlly restore ull
γοα heve given me. Well did Telemachus reply when Menelaus offered him horsea ι
“ Ithace hath no roem for horses, thou son of Atreum thy giffls ere more suimble for
thine own keeping, and there 1 leuve them.” 1 em a· humble mun: Ι love not the
splendours of Rome, but the esse of Tibur and the soflzness of Tarentum.

when Philippus, that stout orator, was returning home from the Forum, tired und out of
spirits, he saw one sitting in e barber-'s shop lazily per-ing his mile: ‘ Go‚' said he to
his slave, ¹ go end find out who thet men is, and all about him! Ee provee to be one
Mena, a erier, of small means und good character, aud well known us un active, sensible
mun, well content with his condition. ‘ 1 should like to hear all this from himself ε
invite him to dine with me! The man can hardly believe his ears ε however hebegs to
be excused. Philippus was surprised, but next morning saw the meu st en audien
and repeated his invitation, and it was accepted. The dinner went off agreesbly, and
was often repeated till the men became en established guest. One holidny he veut
with his patron into the country, end was delighted with ell he saw. Philippus sev ια
opening for s joke, and persuaded the mnu to buy himself ι pieee of ground. To make
e long story short he was soon turned into e fermer, tulked of nothing but husbnndry,
end worked himself to death. Then come losses: his sheep ure stolen, his gnata get
the rot, his crops fail, his steers are worn out, till he oen stand it uo longer, but mounm
his horse end rides off to Philippus, end enta-ests him by all he holds secred to restore
him the life he hus lost.

And so let every man do who has found out thet he *has mede e bed exchnnge. Let him
go back to his first estate5 and let each take eure to measure himself by his own
standard.
