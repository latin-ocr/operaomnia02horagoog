Occupat et salvere jubet prior.

HORATII FLAOOI

Ille Philippo

Excusare laborem et mercenaria vincla,
Quod non mane domum venisset, denique quod non

Providisset eum.

“ Sic ignovisse putato
Me tibi si coenas hodie mecum.''

“ Ut libet? ‘.‘ Ergo 70

Post nonam venies; nunc i, rem strenuus auge.''
Ut ventum ad coenam est, dicenda tacenda locutus

Tandem dormitum dimittitur.

Hic ubi saepe

Occultum visus decurrere piscis ad hamum

Mane cliens et jam certus conviva, jubetur

(iv. 15). On the word ‘ scruta‚' which
significa ,small warea, Comm. Cruq. says=
“ Semta, quas vulgus grutae vocat :'' it is
derived from the Greek γρύτη, and was
used by Lucilius (ap. Gen. iii. 14), with
its cognate word ‘ scrutarius ε’

“ Quidni? et soeuta quidem ut vendat scru-
fflffiffssqffieQ soleam improbus
dimidiatam.”

As to ‘occupat' see C. ii. 12. 28, n.

67. mercenaria vinem] The bonde
(that is, the occupatione) of buying and
selling. Mena offers these as his excuse
for not having waited upon Philippus in
the morning at his ‘ salutatio‚’ as, aster his
attention of the previous day, he would have
felt bound to do if he had had time.

69. Sic] See Key’s 1.. G. 1451, y. note.
71. Post nonam venies ,·] See above,
v. 47, n. and C. i. 1. 20. ιι.

72. dicenda tacenda Iocutus] This is a
familiar adaptation of the Greek ῥητὸν
ἄρῤητόν τ’ ἔπος (Soph. Oed. Col. 1001),
which was a crmventional phrase. It means
all manner of things. Persius (iv. 5) has
⁴⁶ dicenda tacendaque calles.” Virgil (Aen.
ix. 59522 ‘⁸ digna atque indigna relatu Voci-
serans. ’ Horace means that Vulteius was
placedathis ease byhishost,and, beinga

simple man, talked of what nme uppet-
most without waiting to see if it was out of
season or not. “ Lacaenas .· Vulteius, velut
plebeius, expers retum '' (comm. Cruq.).
This gives the meaning very well. 1 do not
see why Orelli should suppose the poor
man ‘bene potus,' or that he required a
hint to ge away. ‘ Dimittere' was a word
of politeneaa used among equale, as above,

73. Hic ubi saepe] After he hadbrohen
the icc Vulteius was easily persuaded to
&semanimem τε
the rich man's morning receptione, till ou
oue occasion be was invited to acoompany
Philippus to his country seat iu the Sabine
country during the ⁶ fer-iae Latinae! Thia
festival was of the highest antiquity. Its
proper name was latiar- Its most im·
portant feature was a sam-iiico offered on
the Alban mount, which οισι-1609. had been
offered before Rome was built. Tarquinius
Superbus first converted it into a Roman
festival, Niebuhr says (ii. 34). by which lm
means that whereas it had before been pre·
sided over by the Latin dictator, the Roman
king, when the latins were brought into
close alliance with Rome, took that place
himsels3 and though the Latius continued to
send their own magistrates till they lost
their independence, the chief magistrates
of Rome continued to preside over the
sacrifice which was still offered on the Alban
Mouut. The bolidays laated six days, during
which all manner of festivities went on, and
business was suspended. They were ⁶ feriae
conceptivae,’ that is, they were annual, but
not held always at the same asason, which
is what Horace means by calling them ‘iu—
dictae.' The magistrates appointed the
time of their celebration.
