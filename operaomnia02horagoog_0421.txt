HORATII FLAOOI

Namque est ille pater quod erat meus.'' ‘⁶ Hoc tibi Paullus
Et Messalla videris? At hic, si plostra ducenta
Ooncurrantque foro tria funera magna, sonabit

Cornua quod vincatque tubss3 saltem tenet hoc nos.''

Quem rodunt omnes libertino patre natum,

Nunc, quia sum tibi, Maecenas, convictor3 at olim,
Quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno.

front benches3 the other that Novius has
not reached the equestrian rank which his
colleague has.1 incline to think that the
words are only used fi vely. The early
Commentators took them so, and did not
think of the these-e, from which however
the metaphor may be taken.

41. Hoc tibi Paullus Et Messalla]
⁴ Paullus ' was a cognomen, which appears in
several of the ‘gentes 3' but it is best known
in connexion with the Aemilia gens, and the
persons of L. Aemilius Paullus, who fell at
Cannae (C. i. 12), his son the illustrious
conqueror of Perseus, and the younger
Scipio Africanus, son of the latter. The
Messallae belonged tc the Valeria gens, one
of the oldest in Rome. This branch of the
⁴ gens ' were highlydistinguished, but Horace
introduces the name probably out of com-
pliment to his friend Corvinus, for whom he
wrotcC. iii. 21. Asto‘ hoc,' inthesense
of‘ propter hoc,' see above, S. 1. 46, ιι.
The same person who puts the question

‘tune Syri, διο. ?’ is here supposed to re-
join, saying, that though this worthy tri-
bune has a colleague a degree less illus·
tricus than himself he need not think
himself a Paullus3 and besides, though
Novius be his inferior in one way, he beate
him in strength of lungs, ‘⁴ and that is what
we like,’' where the speaker ironically puts
himself for the people.

43. concurrantque som tria funera]
These would be public sanctule, ‘funera
indictiva, at which the corpse of the de-
ceased was carried in procession from his
house, with the noise of trumpets and horus
aud fifes3 and women (⁶ praefices ') singing
dirgcs3 and ‘mimi,' dancers and stage·
players, who recited suited to the
occasion, aud sometimes acted the part of
:serry-andrum, mixiug mirth with woe3

and after these came men who represented
the ancestors of the deceased, wearing
maske suited to each character, and then
the corpse on an open bier, which was
followed by the relations and friends all
dressed in black. They went thus in pro-
cession tc the Forum, when the bier was set
down, end one of the relations pronounced
a funenl oration, aster which the body was
taken up again, and the processioa went on
with the same noisy accompaniments tc the
place without the city (intra-mural burisls
were forbidden by the lawe of the twelve
tables), where the body was first to be
burnt and then buried. (See Beck. Gallus,
Exc. ‘ Infcrment of the Deed.') The idiom
⁶ magna sonabit ' opcurs above, 8. 4. 43, ‘os

v .

49. forsit] A few MSS. have ‘ ἴοι-ωιι,1
but ⁴ forsit ' is in most. The oldest editions
1 have seen have all ⁴ forsan! Lambinus
restored ‘ forsit,' which is compounded of

‘fors sit.' whether it occurs elsewhere, or
whether the passages in which it is supposed
to occur are correctly copied, is doubted.
Forcell. gives one example from Luta-etius
which seems genuine. Horace says it might
be that people had cause to grudge him
the honourable post of military tribune,
becam he was not qualified for it3 but no
one could deny that he deserved the friend-
ship of Maecenas, because he was so parti·-
cular in choosing only the deserving.

‘Prsva ambitione' means low flattery, to
which Maecenas would not listen.

52. Felicem dicere] ⁸ Felix ’ is ⁸ lucky!
Horace means he did not owe his introduc-

'tlon to Maecenas to his luck, but fc his

friends. As to ⁶ hoc,’ see above, v. 41, ιι.
