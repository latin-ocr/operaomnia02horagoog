“ Sic me,'' mirator cunni Cupiennius albi.
Audire est operae pretium, procedere recte

Qui moechos non vultis, ut omni parte laborent;
thue illis multo corrupta dolore voluptas,

Atque hacc rara, cadat dura inter saepe pericla.

Hic se praecipitem tecto dedit; ille flagellis

Ad mortem caesus; fugiens hic decidit acrem
Praedonum m turbam; dedit hic pro corpore nummos ;
Hunc perminxerunt calones; quin etiam illud

Accidit, ut quidam testes caudamque salacem

36. C‘u pienum] This person is identi-
fied hythe Scholiasta with one C. Cup ien-
nius Libo of Cumae, a favour-ite of Augustus
without any probability. The name, ac-
cording to them, and in the old editions,
was Cupennius.1ambiuus and most edi-
tore aster him have Cupiennius. As to

‘albix see v. 63, ιι.

38. Qun· moechos non cultim] Most of
the MSS. aud editions have the dative
4 moechis.' But the accusative ie found iu
the following verses of Ennius, quoted by
the Scholiasta, from which these are closely
imitated. ·-

“Audire est operae

one else said they richly deserved it: Galba
said nay. ' This person, whom the Scho-
liasts call a ‘jurisconsultum' is by most
modern interpreteris, following Torrentius
(to whom Weichert, quoted by Orelli ae
the author of the ιιοιίοιι, was indebted for

it.) identified with A. Ga’lba, a parasite of
Augustus of loose character. of whom Plu-
tarch telle a well· known anecdote' ιιι regu-d
to Maeeeuas’ ιγ for hie wife (Erot.
c. 18). Having little regard for his own
honour as a husband, he thought, Horace

Galba mentioned by Juvenal (ἔμω v. 3 sq.)·--
“si potes illa pati quae neo Sarmentus

The ιιὶιιιο therefore seems to have become
rover inl.

does the same with the women, as Torren-
tius says. He is wrong however iu refer-
