SATIRARUM 11. 6. 513

SATIRE VI.
A.1J.c. 724.

Whenever Horace touches on matters personal to himself he does it with humour and
feeling. He is also very skilful in telling a story or representing a dramatic tableau.
The fable of the town and country meuse could hardly have been better told than it is
here. The apostrophe to the country beginning ⁴ Ο rus, quando te aspiciam,' and tha
contrast between a town and country life, are among his most natural touches; and the
allusion to his intimacy with Maecenas, and the envy it had brought upon him, is
managed with delicacy towards his patron, while it shows in a very few words the mixture
of pride and annoyance which the feeling against him caused. He outlived this feeling,
as he tells us in C. iv. 3. 16 (see Introduction); but at this time it perhaps caused him a
good deal of paim for he was not a man of vigorous temperament capable of disregarding
a jealousy he did not deserve, and he had none-of the ambition which overleaps the
jedousy it creatas. He had no desire to be'smixed up with public affairs3 and if he
sought Maecenas, it was in gratitude for his kindness and for the pleasure of his society,
and that of the circle to which his patr-onage introduced him. When therefore vulgar
people appealed to him as the depositary of state secreta and in the great man's con-
fidence, it disturbed and annoyed him probably, as he here with evident sincerity pro-
sesses.

The historical references in this Satire mark the date of its composition pretty accu-
rately. It appears (v. 53) that the Daci were in arms against the Romans. They helped
Antonius at Actium (C. iii. 6. 1⁴, n.,) and the following year, Anu. c. 724, Μ. Crassus
was sent against them. (Dion Cass. li. 23.) In the same book (c. 3, sq.) Dion
relatas that the vetet-ans who had fought at Actium, having been sent back to Italy, were
discontented and broke out into mutiny because they had no reward. In the middle of
the winter of A. u. c. 723—724, Augustus came from Asia to Brundusium for the purpose
of quelling this mutiny, and gave money to some, and to the others he distributed land in
those districts which had been favourable to Antonius. This distribution had been pro-
mised but not made when this Satire was written (v. 55). In the absence of Augustus,
when he went against Antonius and till his return to Rome, Maecenas, at first singly
and Μαι-(18 in conjunction with Μ. Agrippa, was deputed by Augustus to exercise
those powers in the city and in Italy which he himself would have exercised had he been
there. (Dion Cass. li. ὃς Pliny xxxvii. 4.) This too is referred to in v. 38: all of which
goes to indicate the beginning of mmo. 724 as the time when this Satira was written.
In v. 40he says that upwards of seven years had passed since he became intimate with
Maecenas3 add to that the nine months that elapsed between his first introduction and
his recall (S. i. 6. 61), and we bring the former event to the beginning of Α.σ.ο. 716. How
long he had been in possession of his Sabine estate we cannot gather from this Satireg
but there is nothing in it to disturb the opinion that it was presented to him either in
A. u. c. 721 οι· 722. He speaks familiai-ly of a country life no doubt, but one or two
seasons there would give him a sufficient taste of that way of living to account for any
expressions in this poem. 1
