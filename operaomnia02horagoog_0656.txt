true a mun msy live pretty wellin obscurity und μονα-τῃ but the soope of the Epistle is
to oommend end to touch a different doen-ine. The subject is tsken up again in the next
Epistle.

ARGUMENT.

Seeevs, you know how to take esre ot* your-eis, end how to treet the flent people; still,
though it be but the blind leading the blind, see if you oen get u hint or two from your
good friend.

If you wiah for sleep by night end quiet by day go to quiet Ferentinum. Heppineee is not
ooufined to the rich: he too does well who lives und dies in retirement. But if you
would benefit your friends und yourself‚ go ss a poor to the rich men. ⁴ If Aristippus ,
oould leorn to dine upon herbs he would heve no mind for the oompsny of kiugs,’ said
Diogenes. ⁸ If my reprover knew how to keep oompeny with kings, he would heve
no mind for herba: said Aristippus. ⁴ It 1 plesse mynis, you plesse the people. My
line is better thsnyours. 1 puy my duty to the king, und Ι ride end foed uthis expense.
Yon beg alme, und so become lower then the lowest, though you profess to want nothing
st ull! Nothing eume omiss to Aristippus. He aimed high, but vus content with what
he hud3 but es for the Cynic, 1 should like to know how a change of life would heve
suited him. The one carried himself well in the most crowded plaee- iu purple or in
rugsg the other abhors {ine clothes, und will die of oold rather than ven· any but his
old abolla. well, give it him book, end let the fool live. Victories end triumphs ere
very fine things, no doubt ς but to wiu the favour of the great is n'o mesu merit. It is
not every body who een go to Corinth. He who is afr-uid he shall not suooeed sits end
does nothing. Let him poss. But he who does sucoeed, is not he s meu ? Ney, if it
be sny where, here is the very thing we ere looking for. The one shrinks from the
burthen because it is too much for him, the other takes it on his shoulders eud eurriee
it through. If merit be not sn empty nume, surely he does well who leaves no stone
unturned in pursuiug his reward.

They who say nothing ln the great msu’s presence about their own poverty will get more
than they usk: there is u grest differenoe between sustohiug sud modestly receiving.
And this is the secret of sueoese. He who eries, ⁴ Ι heve s poor sister, un infirm mother,
md my estete is worth nothing, and will not support us,’ might just as well say et
onoe, ⁴ Give me breed! Another chimes in with, ‘Let me too have e slioe in my turn!
If the blookheud could heve held his tougue he might heve got more mest end less
squsbbling for it. If a men going into the oountry with his great friend complains thot
the roeds ere eo mugh, sud the onld end vet so bitur, thet his box hus been broken
open sud his money stolen, it is like the women's trick who every now end theu ories
