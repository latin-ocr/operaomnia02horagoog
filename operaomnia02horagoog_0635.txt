HORATII FLAOOI

Cum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri

Nil parvum sapias et adhuc sublimia cures:

Quae mare compescant 0811888, quid temperet 8111111111,
Stellae sponte 8118 jussaene vagentur et errent,

Quid premat obscurum lunae, quid proferat orbem,
Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors,

Empedocles 80 Stertinium deliret acumen.

Verum seu pisces seu porrum et caepe trucidas
Utere Pompeio Grosph0, et si quid petet ultro

14. Oum tu inter scabiem] There 18 no
reflection on Iccius in these words. His

seer of α large 881810 would bring α good
deal of ditty work upon his hsnds, end the
words ατο well suited to express 1110 oon-

16. Quae mare compereant 8811808]

ατο here more particularly referred to, 118
,seems to hsve held with the Eleatic school
of Xenophanes end Parmenides. What we
know 01· 1118 (1006108818 chiefly derived from
fragments of two 1100108ἰο hexameter verse,

other on Nature, unless, which is most
probable, they are parts of the 88100 poem.
His views ατο rendered more difficult of
comprehension by the 111-8181181οο, which
runs through his works end mystifies his
style, to divine powers. (See A. P. 463,
sqq.) Lucretius (i. 732, sqq.) says of 1118
poems (of which, 80 fsr 88 1110 fragments

They were much read end 81111111·οᾶ by the

Cicero alludes (de Amic. vii.) when 118 ⁵⁸5⁸
