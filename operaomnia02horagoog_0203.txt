HORATII FLACOI

I pete unguentum, puer, et coronas

Et cadum Marsi memorem duelli,

Spartacum si qua potuit vagantem
Fallere testa.

Dic et argutae properet Neaerae

Murrheum nodo cohibere crinem

 

Si per invisum mora janitorem

Fiet, abito,

Lenit albescens animos capillus 25
Litium et rixae cupidos protervam
Non ego hoc ferrem calidus juventa

Consule Planco.

erat domesticus; tumultum Gallicum quod
erat Italiae finitimus3 praeterea nullum
nominabant. Gravius autem tumultum esse
quam bellum hinc intelligi licet quod bello
vacationes valent tumultu non valent-'⁹
Agiria, Cicero says (iu Verr. ii. 4. 23),
“ Scuta si quando conquirantur a privatis
in bello ac tumultu, tamen homines inviti
dant, etsi ad salutem communem dari sen-
tiunt-'⁹ Tumultus, therefore was· a public
affair, “a sudden rising or hostile demon-
stration,” as Mr. Long says on the above
passage. ⁴ vis: ⁴ violence,’ was either ⁴ pub-
lica' or ‘privata,' and the distinction be-
tween the two will be found on referring to
the article ⁴ Vis’ in Smith’s Dict. Ant.
Horace, says he, is not afraid of losing his
life by any popular insurrection and so
forth, or by the hand of an assassin or
private malice.

18. Marsi memorem duelli,] The Marsis
or Social War continued from A.t1.c. 663 to
665, and the Servile War, headed by Spar-
tacus, from 681 to 683. Theresore the
wine Horace wanted would have been sixty-
five years old at least. There seems to have

been something remarkable in the vintnge
of that period so as to make it proverbialg
for Juvenal, one hundred years afterwards,
speaking of the selfish gentleman who keeps
his beet wine for his own drinking, says,—

4‘ Ipse capillato diffusum consule potat
Calcatamque tenet bellis mgb? duffii),

The ‘adua’ ‘testa,' and ‘ amphora,’ were all
names for the same vessel.

22. Muri-laeum] 1 know no way of set-
tling the orthograpby of this word. ⁴ Mur-
reum’ is Bentley's ς ⁸ Myrrheum’ that of
Lambinus and others. Forcell. gives them
all, and does not dedde. ⁴ Cohibere’ is the
reading of all the MSS. Bentley prefers
his own conjecture ⁴ cohibente!

28. Consule Planta] L. Munatius Plan-
cus was consul with M. Aemilius Lepidus
A.t1.c. 712, at which time Horace was in
his twenty-third yma—This use of the im·
poesect subjunctive is sufficiently common
to have saved Dillenb. his forced interpre-
tation, “ non ego hoc ferrem si essem calidus
juventa qua vigui Consule Planco.”

CARMEN XV.

This ode combines with the lyric something of the spirit of the Epodes. It is impos·
sible to say why Horace chose so often this same subject, but he always handles it very
sharply. (See C. i. 253 iv. 13.) There are not wanting, of course, those who suppose he
wrote under the influence of his own disappointments, and who find particular periods of
his life suitabie for the composition of each. This too has accordingly had diffeoent dama
assigned it. But 1 need not trouble the reader with such discussions.
