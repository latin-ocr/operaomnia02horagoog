SATIRARUM 11. 3. 459

SATIRE III.
A.t1.c. 722.

This Satira appears to have bem written during the Saturnalia in the mouth of De·
camber, Α.υ.ο. 7223 in the year before Agrippa had been Aedile, and his Aedileship is
alluded ιο in v. 18⁶. It was written at Horaee’s eountry house, not long, it may be
supposed, aster it vvas given him. He was improving the house at the time, as we may
infer from v. 308. The Satire is general, taking in the leading viees and follies of human
nature,-—ambition, avasiee, extravaganee, lust, superstition, which are brought together
with some ingenuity.

One Damasippus, a man who had vested a good fortune in speculating as an amateur
in all sorta of eostly articles, particularly vorke of art, in which he was held ιο be a oon-
noieseur, is introduced in a new character as a Stoie philosopher, reproving Horace for
his lasiness, and urg-ing him to write. He relates the story of his own conversion ιο phi-
losophy. which was this. When he had lost all his fortune, and got hopelessly involved
with money-lenden, and found himself laughed at and called madman wherever he went,
hs grew desperate, and was going to throvv himself into the Tiber, when he was ari-ested
by Stertinius, an oraele of the Stoice, who remonstrated with him and oonsoled him, and
at the same time armed hiur against his enemies (v. 297) with along homily, in the eom-se
of which he proved that au the world but the good and vise were as mad as he was. In
this discourse he enumerates the chief features of this universal madness, and this forms

Το Damasippus the Scholiasta give the gentile name J nnius. Ernesti, in his Clavis ιο
Cicero, says that it was a cognomen of the Licinia gens (which is impossible), and Orelli
calls Damasippus Licinius. 1 think it probable he was a Greek and a freedman. Cicero,
wishing ιο purehase a pieee of ground on which to ereet a shrine to the memoryof huia,
heard that Damasippus had some to dispose of on the bank of the Tiber, and commissioned
Atu'cus ιο negotiata with him for it (ad Att. xii. 29. 33). On another occasion he commis-
sioned a friend (Fabius Gallus) to buy him some statues to put in his libi-ary. He bought
some which Cieero did not like, and thought too eostly. It appears that Damasippus had
bid for them too, and wanted to have themg for Cicero writes, “Velim maneat Damasippus
in sententia—si enim non manebit aliquem pssudodamasippum vel cum jactura reperi.
emus ;” by which he means, if Damasippus will not take them off his hands, he must look
ont for some one less knowing or less bold, and part with them if necessary at a sacrifice.
Thau ean be little doubt that the Damasippus here mentioned is the person Horace ints-0·
duees in this Satire. Dosa-ing and other commentatum, following Com. Crnq. (who says
‘⁸ consumpto per mereatum patrimonio ’')‚ eall him a ⁸ meroator,’ which it is plain he was
not. That he was not a regular trader is clear from the people calling him ⁴ Mercurialem'
(v. 25). The ⁸ mercatores ’ vvere always under the protection of Mercnry (u Mercuriales
viri ''), and there would be nothing particular in the applieation of the word to Damasip-
pus if he had not been merely a private person, who had turned his hand to finding. Why
Horace should have ehoeen this man as the mouth-pieee of his Satire does not appear.
He says himself, it is true, that having ruined his own affairs he had nothing to do but to
attend to the affairs of σῶοι-ος which Horace interprets to mean, that he had taken to
giving advice when it was not asked (see v. 27, n.). But Horace may have had better
reasons for employing this man's name, which we have no means of knowing. He may
have ruined himself and taken to eant, ss Horaee here represents3 but we know nothing
farther about him.

Stertinius appears ιο have been an authority among the Stolos of the day. The Scho-
