Lassus ab indomito, vel si Romane fatigat

HoRATn FLAcol ’

Militia assuetum graecari, seu pila velox
Molliter austerum studio fallente laborem,

Seu te discus agit, pete cedentem aera disco;
Cum labor extuderit fastidia, siccus, inanis

Sperne cibum vilem; nisi Hymettia mella Falerno

Ne biberis diluta. Foris est promus et atrum

Defendens pisces hiemat mare:
Lati-antem stomachum bene leniet.

Qui partum? Non in caro nidore voluptas

Summa sed in te ipso est.
