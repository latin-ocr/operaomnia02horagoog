Nodosa corpus nolis prohibere cheragra..

Est quadam prodire tenus si non datur ultra:-
Fervet avaritia miseroque cupidine pectus
Sunt verba. et voees quibus hunc lenire dolorem

Possis et magnam morbi deponere partem.

Laudis amore tumes, sunt certa piacula quae te
Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.
Invidus, iracundae, iners, vinosus, amator,
Nemo, adeo ferus est ut non mitescere possit,

Si modo culturae patientem commodet aurem.

Virtus est vitium fugere et sapientia prima.

Stultitia caruisse.

Vides quae maxima. credis⁴

Esse mala, exiguum censum turpemque repulsam,

probably familiar with it. But the above
epigram confirming the Scholiasts' state-
ments sets the matter at rest. Comm.
Cruq. mentions ⁸ Milonis ⁹ as svarious read-
ing, and one of the Vsficsn MSS. hes that
usme. Dscier quotes a suying of Epictetus
(Dies. i. c. 2), which is much to the purpooe
here: οὐδὲ γὰρ Μίλων ἔσομαι καὶ ὅ ως
οὐκ ἀμελοῖ τοῦ σώματος, οὐδὲ Κροῖσος u·
ὅμως οὐκ ἀμελῶ τῆς tripos-oc, κακλ.

31. Notiora-prohibere cher-apra.) The
gout in the hand is called ⁸ nodosa from
its twisting the J‘oints of the fingere S. ii.
215). The construction of ‘probi '
with the accusative of the person and ab-
Ιιείὲο of thle thing is repented with ⁸ sroeo '
in . 8. 0.

3213pEct quadam prodire tenue] Horace
is probably indulging a little irony at the
expense of the philosopher-s in the implied
comperison of their perceptione end powers
with those of Lynceus and Glycon, end in
the humble tone he takes towards them.
⁸Tenus‚’ ss s general rulo, takes the ab·
lstive of the singular, sud is so used in the
compound words ⁸ hactenus‚' ⁸ estenus‚’ διο.
The form ⁸ quadamtenus ’ is used occasion-
slly by Pliny as Bentley hss shown, aud
the feminine gender appears in all the
combinatione of ‘tenus' with pronouns. An
the early editions had ⁸ quoddam ' or ⁸ quo-
dem ' till Lambinus introduced ⁸ quadam ’
on his own conjecture. Cruquins ester·
warde found itin his oldest Blandinian MS.
sud adopted it. The two oldest of Pottier's
Parisian MSS. have ⁶ quadam,’ and that
was the first reading of Orelli’s St. Gallen.
In all other MSS. the reading hes been
⁸ quoddam ' or ⁸ quodam) Bentley sud the
majority of modern editors hsve sdopted

⁸ quodam! Fen is certainly wrong iu reed-
ing ⁸ quoddam!

34. Sunt verba et vocet]
Euripides (Hippoi, 478) :—

εἱσίιζ δ’ ἐπῳδαὶ 4,καὶ λόγοι Θελκτὴριοι·
φανησεταί τι τησδε φαρμακον νοσου.

The char-ms Horace means ere the precepta
of the vise to be derived from books (37).
He also cells them ⁸ pisculs’ (36), which is
equivalent to ⁸ medicamenta· because dis-
esse being attributed to the wrath of the
gods, thst which should remove their wrsth
(⁸ piaculum 'P was the means of removing
diseese. ⁸ er’ is ueedby wey os keeping
up the relig-ioue notiou (that number being
common in all religione cermnonies, see C.
i. 28. 36, n.): ⁸ pure’ is used in the same
connexion. The book must be read with e
pure mind, as the body must be wsshed be-
fore sacrifice or libetion ceu be offered.
By ⁸ libello ' Ι understand Horace to mesu
any book that instructs the mind in virtue.

Obburius says, ‘⁸ Sine dubio intelligendus .

est libellus expiationum vel ritus vel ipsas
formulas continens,” books of charms said
to be written by Orpheus Musaeus and
others, which beggurs sud impostore cer·
ried about for sele. Orelli supports this
notiou3 but 1 do not find that ⁸ libellus ⁸
is any where specifically applied to s book
of chumis, or thst such books existed.

cannot all at once sttain perfectiori you may
st least begin to learn, aud the first step
towards virtue is to put awsy vice. What
