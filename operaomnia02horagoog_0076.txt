CARMINUM Ι. 21. 51

CARMEN XXI.

The year ester Augustus retumed to Rome from the taking of Alexandria, thet is
mmo. 726, he dedicated e temple to Apollo on the Palatino hill (C. i. 31), und instituted
quinquenniul gemes iu honour of Apollo ond Dima, ond called them ‘the ⁴ Ludi Actiaci!
For their first celebratiou Frenke supposes Horace to heve written this ode, end Cru-
quius’ Scholinst beers him out by e remark which, though by some confusion it hee got
transferred ιο the saecular ode, belongs plainly to this. The scholiam end some commen-
tntore following them believed this ode to be eu introdueflon ιο the saeculn- San-don, on
whom our neminem· Ἐπειοί. pinned hin tuith, held that opinion, oud pluoed them together,
und eo doec the translator. Frnnke'e opinionis rendered doubtful by the word '¹ principe ⁹
(v. 14), for Augustus did not get thot fitlo till the ides of Jenuery, mmo. 727, end there-
fore nster the first oelebmtion of the Action gemes. Others refer thie ode ιο e later year.
731, when, ee we leern from Dio Ceae. (liv. 1), Rome was visited by peetilenoe end
femine. It ie more likely, es Orelli remarks, to have been un exet-eise from fancy eug-
gested by nome auch festival ee thet of 726. It hae not the dignity or protensione of
uu ode written for such e special ooeesion.
