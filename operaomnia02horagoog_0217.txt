192 HORATII FLAOOI

CARMEN XXI.

The history of L. Valerius Messalla Corvinus, of his learning and eloquence, and the
origin of his double cognomen, under both of which he appears in Horace's poema, are
fully given in Smith’s Dict. Biog. The date of this ode, which is addressed to the testa
containing the wine intended sor Messalla at a supper to which he has invited himself at
Horace’s house, cannot by any sort of evidence be oven conjectured. Dillenbr. says it
was a song composed extempore at a party at which Messalla was symposiarch. In such
extemporaneous effusions Dillenbr. puts more faith than 1 can3 but the ode may have

been recited at the supper-table, and composed for the occasion it professes to have been
composed for.

ARGUMENT.

Thou amphora, who wast filled at my birth, whether thy mission be one of sorrow or joy,
of sta-ise or love or aleep, come down, for Corvinus would have my better wine.
Learned though he be, he will not despise thee, for neither did old Cato. Thou dost
sosten the inflexible‚ and open the heart, and bring back hope, and give suength and
courage to the humble. Liber, Venus, and the Gracoe shall keep thee company till
the dawn of day.
