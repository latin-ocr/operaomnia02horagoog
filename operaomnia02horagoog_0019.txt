xviii IN TRODUOTION..
but there is so much affinity between the Ars Poetica and the Epistle

to Augustus that I believe they were written at no great interval of

time. It seems from the Epistle to Florus that Horace at this time
had to resist the urgency of friends ,begging him to write, one in this
style and another in that, and that 118 11811 110 desire to gratify them and
to sacrifice 1118 own ease to a pursuit in which it is plain he never took
any great delight. He was likely to bring to it less energy‚ as his life
was drawing prematur-ely to a close through infirmities either contracted
or aggravated during his irrational campaigning with Brutus, his 111811111-
tude for which 118 appears afterwards to have been perfectly aware of.
He continued to apply himself to the study of moral philosophy till his
death, which took place, according to Eusebiae, on the 27 th November,
A.U.0. 746, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and within a few days of
its completion. Maecenas died the same year, also towards the close of
it ; a. coincidence that 1188 1811 801118 to the notion that Horace hastened
1118 own death that 118 might not have the pain of ‘surviving hisrpatron.
According to Suetonius his death (which he places aster his fisty-ninth
year) was so sudden that he had not time to execute his will, which 18
opposed to the notion of suicide. The two friends were buried near
one another ‘⁸ in extremis Esquiliis‚” in the farthest part of the Esqui-
liae, that is probably without the city walls, on the ground drained 81111
18111 out in gardens by Maecenas.

'rho plan adopted in this Edition, of commenting on each poem in 8
separate Introduction, rendere it unnecessary to say much in this place
upon Horace’s style and character. The particular style in which his
principal strength lay will be always matter of opinion. My own 18 that
he is nowhere so great 88 111 the Odes, and that of these his genius is
best shown in the Odes that relate to public affairs or men, while in some
of the small occasional pieces‚ 88 the Ode to the Fountain of Bandusia,
that 011 the death of Quintilius, 81111 others, much grace and feeling
are shown. Ι cannot at all agree with those who think that amatory
verse-writing was Horace’s strong point. With rare exceptions his
compositione of ,this kind, however elegant they may be, appear frigid
· and passionless, bearing the stamp of imitation, with unequivocal signs
of art, and none of nature. The crowd of mistresses that have been
gathered for him out of his poems is beyond belief ; and the laborious
folly that has tried to classify his amours, and to follow chronologi-
cally the shisting of his affections, I have had occasion to notice.
It proceeds upon 811 interpretation of the Odes which is foreign to
their true character. Horace was neither more nor less licentious pro-
bably than most of his contemporaries, though his biographer charges
him with gross sensuality3 but, however this may be, that the women
