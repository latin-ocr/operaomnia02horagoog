EPISTOLARUM 1. 1.

Insanire putas sollemnia me neque rides,

Nec medici credis nec curatoris egere

A praetore dati, rerum tutela mearum

Oum sis et prave sectum stomacheris ob unguem

De te pendentis, te respicientis amici.

Ad summam: sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
Liber, honoratae, pulcher, rex denique regum3
Praecipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est.

It may be so, or it may have reference
to alteratione Horace was making on his
estate, in which case the whole would be
only a joke against himself, or nuth in jest,
which Maecenas would understand. He
appears ιο have begua building directly he
entered οιι his new property, if there is any
meaning in the scolding he geta from Dama-
sippus (S. ii. 3. 3⁰7).

102. nee curatoris θρα-ε] See S. ii. 3.
217, ιι. Though in the next line no one
would suppose Horace meant‘ tutela’ liter-
ally, as Orelli say s, who is himself too
litei-al, yet the word is suggested by the
context. ‘’Tutels was the guardianship
of a ‘tutor,’ the protector of an orphan’ s

had the same relation ιο the orphan in a
modified form (see Dict. Ant· Curator ') till
he was twenty-five (see above, v. 22, n.).
It was also that of the protector of insane
persons. Though ⁶ tutela ' therefore is not
the precise word ιο keep up the previous
notion, it has more force here than ⁶ prae·
sidium‚’ by which Orelli explains it. Horace
means that Maecenas looks aster him
anxiously as if he was hia ⁸ tutor,’ and he
looks up ιο him as if he was his ⁴ pupillus,'

greater faults and correct those than be put
out by triffing defecta, such as negligence of
dress, and so forth. What may have passed
between Horace and his pah-on to give rise
ιο this piece of raillery, which is meant to
couvey a satire on the world in general,
especially the fashionable world, with whom
then as now vices were peccadilloes and
breaches of etiquette unpardonable sins, we
cannot tell. He writes to Maecenas out of
the familiarity of frequent intercourse, and
such intimacy gives rise to ideas and lan-
guage which none but the friends themselves
can fully enter into. What Horace says is
a repetition iu a different form of‘ ‘O et
praesidium et dulce decus meum' '.(C i. l.

105. respicientis] For this Heinsius
conjectured and Bentley has adopted‘ sus-
picientis,’ which has no authority, and· is not
wanted. Caesar (B. C. i. l) says, “Sin
Caesiuem respiciant atque ejus gratiam

use of the word. lt is much atron ger than
our term‘ respect? which· is derivedge from it.

106. Λᾶ summam, ·] This is an ordi·
nary formula, ⁶ ιο come to the point‚' ‘to
conclude! The parauit of virtue and wis-
dom is the point from which he started, and
having digressed a little he returns suddenly,
and concludes with a definition of the sage,
which is a repetition of S. i. 3. 124, sqq:

 

dives ui sapiens est,
Et sutor bonus et solus ormosus et estrexl’

Here itis added that he* is the only freeman,

and inferior to Jove alone, and this Acron

e is a use e governs s pas-

sions; he ia free through an indifference
which it is the business of hia life to culti-

πῶς he is rich because he wauts nothing;
he is beautiful because virtue is beautiful;
he is equal to Jove because he rises above
the world, and also because he is above all
human law,-a doctrine which the later
Stoice held as rising naturally out of the per-
fection of his reason and the purity of his mo-
tives. The attempt to apply these notione
to man as he is, led necessarily to practica!
inconsistencies involving the wildest im-
moralities. But the Stoice meant well, and
would have effected a reign of virtue if they
could have had their wishes. Horace says,
with an intentional bathos, the Stoic above
all his other attributes is of course ‘sanus,'
except when his digestion is disturbed and
the phlegm tmublesom03 ‘sanus ’bearing a
double application ιο tlie body (from the
pains of which no exemption was claimed
for the Stoic sage, though he did not allow
them to affect his will) and to the mind, the
sanity of which no one could lay claim to
but the sage himself (see 8.· ii. 3²». 44, n.).
