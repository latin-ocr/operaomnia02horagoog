Cn. Pompeius, he returned to Rome with
great wealth accumulated by himself in Asia
(for he inherited nothing from his father),
which he devoted ιο every sort of aelf·
indulgence3 so that Plutarch (c. 39) com-
pares his life to an ancient comedy, the
first part of which is taken up with political
and military affairs, and the latter part
all sorts of revelling.

His houses (espe-
cially at Naples sud haculum), his gardens
and works of art, and preserves of fish, and
household furniture, and the extravagance
os his meals and way of living, surpassed
any thing that had ever been known before,
and even iu the imperial times his gardens,
Plutarch says, were amongst the most
noble. From his extravagant works, by
which he levelled hills and checked the
waters of the sea, he was called by his con·
temporaries ⁸ Xerxes togatus! Plutarch
relates (in the same chapter) this anecdote
of Horace's, only giving a smaller number
of purple cloaks, which Horace puts at ten
times the number applied sor, and Plutarch,

Lucullus said he would inquire, and if he
had any he would let him have them.
The next day he asked him how many he
wanted, and when the ‘ praetor ⁹ said a
hundred, Lucullus bede him take twice that
number. Plutarch refers to Horace's men·
tion of the story, and seems ιο think his
comment upon it, that a man ιο be rich
ought to know only a small part of his pos·
sessione, is meant seriously. He gives that
as Horace’s opinion, whereas it is plain he
is only speaking ironicslly.

thrown loosel over the person in a variety
of ways (see 'ct. Ant), of which a speci-
men is seen in the Belvedere Apollo. The
Romans did not wear it till the time of the
empire, and it was never mom than an
occasional garment at Rome. Lucullus it
seems hsd brought with him a large number
of a costly kind from Asia, where they were
worn in the Greek citioe. What the repre-
sentation may have been for which the
praetor wanted these ⁴ chlamydes ' is not
certain, but Greek characters must have been
introduced.

of ‘ salutatio’ (when, if he was a person of
consequence, people of all sorts came to
pay him their respectu), and to remind him
of the names and circumstances of his visi-

neoessary for the master to remember. If
he was aiming at any office he had ιο be

classes, and his ‘ nomenclator,’ if he were

in this matter. Horace's advice to the

shows us that the canvassing and elections
