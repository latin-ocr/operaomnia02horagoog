182 HORATII FLACCI

Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam

Majorumque fames. J ure perhorrui

Late conspicuum tollere verticem,
MaecenaS, equitum decue.

Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit,

Ab dis plura feret: nil cupientium

Nudus castra peto et transfuga divitum
Partes linquere gestie,

contemptae dominus splendidior rei',

Quam si quidquid arat impiger Apulus

Occultare meis dicerer horreiS,
Magnas inter opes inops.

Purae rivus aquae silvaque jugerum

Paucorum et segetis certa fides meae

Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae
Fallit sorte beatior.
