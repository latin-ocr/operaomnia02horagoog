SATIRARUM II. 3. 461

(say γοα), διαδοὴαε or Aristippus. who to lighten his alave’s unck bede him throw away
some of the money thot wne in it ‚²⁹ It does not help one moot point ιο ruine another.
A mon that should buy n quantity of musical instrumente who knew nothing of music,
ewls und lusto who was no nhoemnker, sniis who wne no tradem—ull would ny he was
med. Is he leon med who gete money together which he known not how or fetro ιο
use? A man who wntohes over hie heep of oorn but ento only bitter herbe, who hae
his cellar fun of the best wine end drinka only nour, handmme bed-clothes in hie chest
und εἰοορε upon sta-ew, he ie not called mad, only because it ia the medum of οο
many. Are you keeping dl this for your heir to aquandos, old fool? or for four γοα
should come to went? How much would it bke from you to put n drop of better oil
to your oebhege, or ιο eleon your dirty head? What do γοα lie, steni, rob for, if so
little is enough for you? What, ure you sene? 11· you began ιο throw stonee, every
one would eall you med: but yon may uti-engle your wife, or poison your mother, und
γοα ere ull right, because you tre no Orestes of Argos but n gentlemnu of Rome.
But wne not Orestes med before he heti-nyed it by murder-ing his mother? And aster
that he did nothing worse then yourself. Opimius the miser wne nick, end nigh unto
death. His heir was exulting iu the prospect of mooession. His physician how·
ever hed hin money-bago brought out end emptied before him, und net people to oount
the contente. This roueed his potient- Thon says the doctor, ⁸ lt· γοα don’t lake eure,
your heir will carry off eil your money.’ ⁸ What, before 1 em deod Ρ ⁴ well, then,
get upa take some nouriuhment, or you'll die. Come, take nome broth.' ⁸ How
much did it eost ,²⁹ ⁸ Oh not much! ⁴ But how much? ' ⁸ Eight asses! ⁴ Ales,
alas! whot differenoe does it make whether 1 die of dinem or robbery Ξ· ' who
then is enne? He who iu not a fool. But the oovetous? He is a fool, end insane.
But if α man is not eovetoue in he sane? No. A man may bo siclt though he hae
not the beart-burn. A men may not be a perjurer or n miser, for which he my be
thankful3 but it he is ambitione and headan-eug let him go ιο Anticyra.

(v, 166.) ‘⁸ It makes no differenoe whether you throw eway your money or foi-beer ιο use
it. One Servius Oppidius hed two farma, which he geve one ιο ench of his two sons,
and on his death-bed he called them ιο him and naid: ⁸ 1 heve wntched γοα, my sons,
one throwing or giving away his toys, the other hiding them in holes. Take heed leet
γοα fell under opposite mniasae do γοα beware of diminishing, und γοα of incrensing,
the fortune 1 leuve γοα. Ι oeufion γοα both against the temptatione of ambition. My
curse be upon you if you ever aim nt public offioes. You may he tempted ιο ruin
youraelves for populu-ity, aping the munifioenoo of Agrippa ns the fox might ape the
lion.'

(v. 187.) ‘Whyrefuse bui-inl to the great Ajnx, Ο king ?' ‘Because he wne eo med as
ιο kin n flock of sheep end thought he was killing Ulyssoe, Menelauz, end me! ⁴ But
were you sane when γοα offered your child αι Aulis ,² Ajax spnred his own flesh und
blood3 und, though he cui-sed the Atridae, he did not kin either Teucer or even
ulyssea! ‘ But ιο loose the fleet 1 propitiated the gods with blood.’ ‘ Yee, medinm,
with your own.’—Any mnu who takes up false funden is out of hin mind, whether it be
from folly or passion. Ajnx wne mad5 but when you commit crimes for the sake of
empty inscriptions, ure γοα αοι ιο mod ts he? If n mun were ιο oerry about a lamb
and call it his daughter he would be treated as a lunatio. If on the other hand he
were ιο take his daughter for a lamb and eum-ifioe her, he would be called med too.
The fool then is mad, the depruved is more med, but the ambitione is mnddest of ull.

(v. 224.) ⁴⁸ 'rhen for the ependthrist‚ he ie certainly med. A young man eomes into his
futhei-'s propertyz he sends for ull the tredesmen and flings his money at randorn
among them. Another takes a jewel from his mistress’ ear, melts it down aud ewanows
it: another dines habitually on nighfingales. Are these med or not med?

(v. 247.) ⁴⁶ If we see en elderly gentlemen riding on n unck, und ploying et childron'n
