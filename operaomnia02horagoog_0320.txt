‚EPODON LIBER, 8, 9. 295

CARMEN IX.

The dete ofthieodeienottobemisteken. Itmwritten when the news ofActium
was fresh, in September, A.u.c. 723, immediately before the awa of the lot Book. It is
eddroeeed to Maecenas, and it is impossible to read it end suppose he had just arrived
from Actium, where some will have it he was engnged. As to Sanedon, he thinks Horace
wrote ιο Maecenas while he was stin on the other eide of the nter, than which nothing
een be more absurd.

ARGUMENT.

When shall we drink under thy tell roof, Maec-enee, to Caem- the conqueror, es late we
did when the eon of Neptune loet hie fleet end ssed,—he who threatened us all with
the chaine his slaves had worn? Wiu our eone believe it? Romans heve sold them-
selves ιο serve a woman end her eunucha, and the luxurious gauzo heth ssuttered among
the standards of war. But their alliee deserted to our side, and their ships skulked
from the fight. lo Triumphe! bring forth the golden chnriot and the sacrifice. So
great a conqueror never eume from Africa before. The enemy heth changed hie purple

for monrning, and heth fled ιο Crete or the Syrtes, or knoweth not whither ιο fly.

Sicily, mmo. 718, when his fleet was bnrnt
and he himself obliged ιο fly toAsie. Horace
says he threatened ιο fasten upon the free
citizens thone chains which he had taken
from the fugitive slaves who formed ιι large
