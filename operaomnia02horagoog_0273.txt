CARMEN XII.

Before Am. e. 735.

The commentatore are much divided in their opinions as ιο the person to whom this
ode is addressed. The old inscriptions vary, but in such a manner as to show that they
have none of them any weight or authority. Torrentius mentions three MSS. which are
headed “AdV‘u-gilium Unguentarium urbis diem-iptio (the common blunder for ⁸ descriptio')
Panenetioe,” and he himself adopts this absurdity, derived stom v. 17. The Scholiast
Acron says, ‘⁸ Ad Virgilium negociatorem sta-ibitss’ which is a mere assumption from the
opening lines and v. 25, and when heinterprets “juvenum nobilium '³ (v. 15) as Augustus,
or Maeeenasm the step-sons of Augustus, he shows he knew nothing of what he was writing
about. If the question were to be deeided by numbers, it would on the whole be given in
favour of Virgil the poet, and the presumption is so much in favour ot· that notion that
the onus probandi lies 1 think with those who deny it. Gesner says there is nothing in
the ode to indicate so warm a friendship as subsisted between Horace and the poet Virgil-
But the ode is at best a trifle, and an invitation to dinner is not the most inspiring subject.
When Virgil. was going to sea, perhaps for his health, Horaee's feeling for him was shown
strongly enough, which would be natural. Orelli and others object to the expression
‘⁸ juvenum nobilium cliens‚” as applied to Virgilius Maro. But, if the Scholiasta are agreed
that ‘juvenum ⁹ may mean Augustus and Maecenas, they at least oonoede the point that
‘ cliens’ may mean virgil the poet. Aug-ustus is represented as a ‘ juvenis' in the second
ode of the first book, v. ⁴1 (where see note). The difficulty that arises out of v. 25, ⁶ pone
—studium lucri,' Orelli himself dispones of when he says that it is evidently a joke; for,
though he also says that such a joke levelled at such a man would be very flat, this cau
hardly be determined till we know the point of it. We need not nsume with Stephens
(Diatr. iv. p. 76) that Horace means by ⁶ studium lucri‚' ‘ mercaturam bonarum artium ³
(Cic. de off. iii. 2), or the expectation of peyment sor his verses. 1f there be a joke, Vir-gil
understood it, whoever Virgil wan but be he who he may we do not understand it, so
that nothing is gained by this argument. 1 have not seen all that has been said upon the
subject, which has been discussed in separate steatises and in all commentaria, and which
must always romain matter of opinion founded upon very slender data: but my own
Judgment is in favour of supposing the ode ιο be an early one addreoeed to P. Virgilius
Maro, the poet, not to ‘⁸ some relation or client of his,” nor to ‘⁸ the gnudson of C. Ver-
gilius, the praetor and friend of Cicero,” nor to ‘⁴ a physician of the Nerones,” nor to a
bader, nor ιο a persumet. The pastoral images and description in the three first stanna
have always appeared to me particularly suited to an ode addressed ιο Vir-gil the author of
