Propertius likewise has the same idea in his

elegy to Tullus (i. 6. 1, sqq.) 2-

“ Non ego nunc Adriae vereor mare noscere
Tutllegurigt'lue Aegaeo ducere vela salo.

Cum quo Rhipaeos possim conscendere

maeiffiss’m domos vadere Memnonia-52⁹

With these examples before him it is sur-
prising that Graevius should have gone with
Dacier in supposiug that Horace and Sep·
timius had engaged to join the Cant-brian
ex 'tion.

gednAww — colono] Catillus or his
brother Tiburtus (see C. i. 18. 2, ιι.).

7. sie modus laeso] ⁴ lasso’may be taken
with ‘ maris,' διο. (as ‘fessi rerum,’ Aen. i.
182), or absolutely, leaving the genitives to
depend on ⁴ modus :’ or the genitives may
depend upon both.

10. pellitis] One of the Scholiasta in-
terprete this ‘ lanatis, villosis‚' and some
take ‘ dulce' with ‘ pellitis) which leaves no
word to govern ‘ ovibus.’ ⁴ Pellitis' is more
generally and correctly supposed to refer to
the practice of covering the sheep with skins
to preserve their wool. The Galaesus (Ga-
laso) flowed through the ager Tarentinus,
which was rich in gardens and corn-land, as
well asin pastures. How Phalanthum, the
leader of the Partheniae, emigrated from
Lacedaemon and got possession of Taren-
tum, is related by J ustin (iii. 4).

ll. reynata] Similar passives are found
in C. iii. 3. 43, “ Medis triumphatis ;” iii.

19. 4, ‘⁴ Bella pugnata ;” Epod. i. 23, “ Bel·
lum militabitur-W S. ii. 5. 2¹7, ‘⁴ Res cer·
tabitur.” ⁴ Regnata’ occurs again in C. iii.

29. 273 and Tacitus (Hist. i. 16) speaks of '
.“ gentes quae regnantur.” The word is not

used by prose-writers of an earlier age than

Tacitus.

15. decedunt] This word is used again
in the same sense of ⁴ giving place ω’ in the
second epistle of the second book, v. 213:
“ decede peritis.”

18. ⁴ Aulon' is stated by Acron to have
been a hill near Tarentum3 by Porphyrion
a place fruitful in vines. Bentley, disliking
the epithet ⁴ fertili’ for ⁴ Boccho: made with
some MSS. ⁸ fertilis ς’ and, as thia rendere it
necessary to get rid of ⁶ amicus‚’ he does
by changing it ‘levissima mutatione’ into
⁴ apricus! He quotes Acron ‘in loco,'
who says of the climate of Tarentum ‘⁴ et
melle et olivetis praecellit hiemes quoque

¹ apricus m iseopy. o . we
know of has it.

The honey of Tarentum or Calabria (iii.
16. 33), and of Matinum (iv. 2. 27) ἰιι Italy,
of Hybla in Sicily, and of Hymettus in
Attica, are those Horace celebrates most.
Venafrum (hod. Venafro) the most northern
town of Campania was celebrated above all
places in Italy for its olives. ‘Venafro' is
the dative case. See C. i. l. 15, ιι.

21. beatae — arcem] ‘ Rich heights’ of
Aulon or other hills near Tarentum. ⁴ Arx.'
which is derived by Forcellini from ἄκρος.
is rather akin to ἕρκος, and siguifies prim·-
