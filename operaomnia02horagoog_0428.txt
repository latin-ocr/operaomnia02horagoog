under the‘ cavea,’ and carried 00 their vile
trade there, and 1133 surrounded with shops
established for the benefit of the spectatore.
The Circus Maximus was called 0110113
κατ’ ἐξοχὴν. When there were no 13003
or 331003 301113 011, it was probably fre-
quented 33 a 1011030 by all manner of
people.1 know 110 othery way of explaining
Horace’ s words. There could be nothing
in 013 301113 to the Circus as a spectator
of the games, which 311 01ος but probably
1000 of consequence did not care to be seen
there among the vulgar at other times.
The Forum was not frequented in the even-
ing by the richer 01333 of people, who were
then eating their dinner. Horace liked to
311011 out at that bour, and take his light
meal aster-warda, and to stop and hear what
the fortunetellers had to say for themselves.
Respecting these 11013003, 300 0. 1. 11, In-
troduction.

115. Aa porri et ciem-is] This Pytha-
gorean meal of 100113, pube, and fritters,
was partly perhaps matter of choice, and
partly of necessity. Horace wa poor at
this time, and his health was indifferent.
A vegetable diet was and is much 111010
common in Italy than with 113; and probably
the most luxurious of the Romans, when by
themselves, frequently abstained from meat.
A dish of ⁴ cicer‚’ ready boiled, was sold in
the streete for 311 33 10 the time of Mar-
tial (1.104. 10)· “Asse cicer tepidum con-
stat.’ A vegetable dinner, with a great
variety of 0131103, 13 described by Martial‘ 10
an invitation to a 010110”1.78).”Ιι330113
13 described hythe Scho iasts 33 3 flat thin
calte, fried and caten with condiments.1t
was sometimes fried under roast meat 01
sowa, 30 as to get their dripping, and 30
would be like our Yorkshire pudding.
Horace had no doubt the plainer sort.

116. pueris tribum] This numberwas
the lowest probably that at that time waited
on any person who had any slaves at all.
(See above, on v. 108.) ’ Lapis albus’
was 3 small side-table of white marble.
The wealthy Romans had a great variety of
tables of the handsomest sort in their
dining 100103 for exhibiting their plate.
(See below, S. ii. 4, n.; and above, S. 3.

13,1ι.) An the plate Horace had to show
was two 011113 and a cyathus (0. iii. 19. 12),
and these itis probable 11010 usually empty.
Fea says that* plapis albus’ does not mean
a table, but 3 31311 with 11010010 which the
011113 (1111030 bottoms, he says, were round,
and so not suited to standing on a plain
sui-face) were placed. It was called by the
Greeks ἐγγυθήκη (Athen. viii. 5), by the
Romam ’ 1001ιο33,’ acorruption of the same
word. (Forcell. has given a very sar- fetched
derivation to this word.) This slah Fea
says 1133 supported by another below it,
the upper 000 being called ‘basia' the
other‘ hypobasisf 33 appears in an inscrip-
tion he quotes from Gruter, which records
the presentation to Heroides of “ 033-
1113311. 33013000111111111311. cun. 11331.
sua. 31. armani. nannonsal’ But
there is not enough in what he says to fix
this meaning on ‘ lapis albus,' which 1
should not have noticed if Orelli had not
adopted Fea's explanation. The ’ echinus ²
is a vessel no where 0130 mentioned by that
name, and it would be tiresome to the
reader if 1 were to go through all that the
commentatore have said upon the subject.
The Scholiasta give us the choice between a
salt-cellar (in the shape of an ’ echinus'), a
glass bottle‚ 3 leather bottle, and a wooden
bowl in which to wash the cups. This last
is the explanation adopted by Heindorfi
Cruquius says, “ 100113 0113001113 est et ipso
echino spinosior. ’' Fea contenda for the
salt-cellar, thinking Horace 001110 not omit
311 mention os that. (See S. 3. 14, 11.)
Some MSS. according to Lambinus, have
‘echinoss making ‘vilis’ agree with the
following substantives.1 am not aware
that they are entitled to any weight‚ but
Gesner edits ‘ echino! ’ Paterae' were
broad flat saucer-shaped cupa, and were
much used in libatione. ’ Guttus’ was a
long thin-necked bottle from which wine or
oil was poured very slowly, drop by drop.
It was also used in libatious, and these two
1333013, as here joined, have reference to
the practice of offer-ing a libation at every
meai to the ‘lares.' See 0. iv. 5, 11. These
were of the commoneat earthenware which
came from Campania. See S. ii. 3. 144.
