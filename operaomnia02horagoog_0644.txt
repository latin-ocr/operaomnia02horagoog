The connexion of this with the professed object of the letter 1 do not quite see.

Elea, famous as the residence of Xeno-
phanes, the founder of the Eleatic school of
philosophy, and the birth-place of Parme-
nides and Zeno, was a town of Lucania,
near the mouth of the river Heles or Elees
(Alanto). It was said to have been founded
about Α. ιι. c.. 300· by the Phocaeans of
Ionia on the occasion of their mig-ration re-
lated by Herodotus, i. 165 (see Epod. xvi.
15, n..) The ruins of the town still exist
on the site called Castelamare della Brnca.
From the Topica of Cicero (c. i.) and Epp.
ad Fam. (vii. p20) we learn that Trebatius,
who is introduced in S. ii. 1, had estates
there. On his way from thence to Rhegium,
when he ssed from Rome after the death of
Caesar, Cicero compiled the Topica, and he
wrote the above letter to Trebatius from
that place, and probably from his house,
which he makes remarks upon. There are
many coins of Velia extant with the in-
scriptions ΥΕΛΗ. ΥΕΔΗΤΩΝ. ΕΈΛῙΑ.
Salernum in Campania was situated at the
head of the bay of Paestum, now the Gulf
of Salerno, on the heights above the modern
town, which is close to the sea. It was a

Velia or

Roman colony, but was originally built only
as a fortress ιο be a check on the Picentini,
in whose country it was situated. Tbese
places were not very much frequented it
would seem at this time, but a new doctor
was bringing them into fashion. Salernum
was situated on a very read, the Via
Aquilia, of which there was a branch from
Picenum as far as Paestum. From thence
to Velia, about twenty miles, there was no
Roman road.

2. Baias] The atmosphere of Baiae
appears to have been clear, and the place
attractive (Horace calls it ‘liquidae,’ C. iii.
4. 24, and ‘amoenae‚’ Epp. i. l. 83).
This made it the most favourite resort of
wealthy Romans. To invalida there was
the additional attraction of hot sulphureus
zpfings. δεῖ among other places Ovid
A. A. i. 255 :—

⁶⁴ Quid ᾔει-ιω Baias, praetextaque littora
ve

Et quae de calido sulphure fumat,
aquam. >¹⁹

and Statius (Silv. iii. 5. 96)· -

“ Sive vaporiferas, blandissima littora, Baias,
ξιέἷὲιθωώῗιίᾱὶωο seu visere tecta Sibyllae

Horace had been in the habit of going to
Baiae, as we may infer from his connecting
it wit‘h the Sabine hilis, Praeneste, and
Tibur ιιι C. iii. 4, but it appears he was now
advised to try a different treatment, and
seek some other climate. Δ. letter of
Cicero’ s to Dolabella (ad Fam. ix. 12)
begins in this jocular way· -— “Gratulor
Baiis nostris siquidem ιιι scribis salubres
repente factae sunt. nisi forte te amant et
tibi assentantur et tamdiu dum tu ades
sunt oblitae sui.” The place therefore was
not healthy in Cicero's opinion, or Dola-
bella had found it disagree with him before.
‘Supervacuus ’ means ‘uselesa,' the plaoe
would do him no good.

3. Musa—Antonius] This physician
was a freedman of Augustus, and came into
notice chiefly through curing him of a bad
illness he contracted in the Cantabrian ex-
pedition (see above, Epp. 13. 3), on which
occasion Suetonius (c. 81) tells ns that Au-
gustus· ‘distillationibus jecinore vitiato ad
desperationem redactus contrariam ct ancipi-
tem rationem medendi necessario subiit, quia
calida fomenta non proderant, frigidis curari
coactus, auctore Antonio Musa,” which
gave rise to the caustic words Seneca makes
Livia address to Augustus (de Clemen. 9.
4) :—“ Fac quod medici solent ubi usitata
remedia non procedunt. tentant contraria.”
It seems that in consequence of this cure
Musa came into fashion, and having found
cold bathing successful with the emperor,
he appears gto have made that his general
principle of treatment. At any rate he re·
commended it to Horace, the Scholiast says,
for his eyes; and he followed his advice,
not without reluctance, as it would seem
from this Epistle. A statue was erected to
Musa by subscription near that of Aescu·
