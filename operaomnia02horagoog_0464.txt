Scipiadam ut sapiens Lucilius.''

might be supposed to be taken from the
same idea. It merely means ⁶ nerve,’
‘ vigour! See S. i. 10. 53, ιι. As to ‘de-
duci,’ see S. i. 10. 44, ιι.

4. Trebula] See Introduction.

7. Optimum erat .·] Here as below (v. 1⁶)
the imperfect indicative is used where the
subjunctive might be expected. The Greeks
in similar cases sometimes used the imper·
fect indicative without ἄν, where the usual
construction required that word.

Ter uncti flammato Tiberim] See S.
i. 6.123, n. Tim langunge is a little in the
style of a ‘ lex.' ‘ Sub noctem ’ means
immediately after nightfall. See Epod. ii.
44, n. S. ii. 7. 109. Epp. ii. 2. 169. It
appears from Cicero's letters to 'lh-ebetius
that he was a great swimmer‚ and Cicero
describes himself as having gone home from
his house one night ‘⁶ bene potus seroque ’²
(ad Fam. vii. 22). He may therefore have
lived pretty freely.

lo. rapit] Bentley, with no authority
worth consideration, substitutes ⁴ capit,¹ and
thereby weakens the sentence. Thereisforce
in ‘ rapit,’ ⁴ hurries you on like a torrent!

. lg. qssar'vic] This ctu-responds to ὁ τυχών
ιιι ree .

14. fracta pereuntes cuspide] Phitarch,
in his life of Marius (c. 25), relates how, on
the oooesion of a battle with the Cimbri,
he altered the spesi-s of the soldiers in such
a way that they could not be οἰ use to the
enemy. He says that the epear-heads were
formerly fastened to the shaft by two iron
nuile, and that Marius removing one sub-
stituted for it a wooden pcg, which would
give way when the spear struck the shield,
where it would stick and drag along the

“ Haud mihi deero

ground. As early as the year mis-o. 715
Augustus was engaged in putting down dis-
turbances in Gaul, and Agrippa was sent

there by him two years asterwards. At Ο

sundry times between that and his victory
at Actium he was engaged in the same
quarter, as Franks has shown from the his-
torians3 and he included his victories over
the Gauls in the first of his three days’
triumphs A.u.c. 723 (Dion Cass. li. 21).
For his statement about the Gauls there-
fore Horace has sufficient foundation. The
Parthians falling under blows inflicted by
the arms of Aug-ustus, is a picture he draus
from his own imagination3 for the first time
Aug-ustus came in contact with the Parthians
was in ΛΑΜ). 724, when, aster the battle of
Auium and the taking of Alexandria, he
went into Asia and Syria, and there 'Rndates
fied to him for protectioni from Phraates
(see C. i. 26, Introduction). Not a blow was
struck, nor did he encounter any Parthian
force at all, theu σι· at any subsequent time.
On ‘labentis equo,’ see C. i. 1. 39, ιι.

16. poteras] See above, v. 7. As to ‘for-
tem‚' see what is said of ‘Fortitudo' on
C. S. v. 57.

17. Scipiadam ut sapim Lucilius]
Virgil uses this form §Georff ii. 170),
“ Scipiadas duros bello! As the Elder
Scipio had Ennius to praise him (see C. iv.
8), so the younger had Lucilius, who was
his intimate friend, and who served under '
him in the Numantian War. ' There is no
neoessity for supposing that Lucilius wrote
a separate poem on the exploits of Scipio,
though it is not improbable that he did so.
‘ Sapiens ⁹ is applied to the poet ae ⁴ doctus '
is elsewhere. See note on C. i. 1. 29.
