53. odor nervis inimicus ‚·] This means
what we cell the bouquet which helped
the wine in ite intoxicating effecte upon the
brein. With the inferior wine· vui-ioue
aromatico were frequently introduced for
the purpose of giving them en agreeeble
perfume.

58. Thetis marcentem squillis] When
the guest hes got surfeited or ‹li-ank so
much he cannot digest any more, his eppe·

annila, of which the best sort cume from the
coest of Africa, end were called· Solitanael
the derivation of which neme is uncertain,

Comm. Cruq. says that ‘hina ' is e diminu-
tive form of ‘hirnz’ “et significet intes-
tinum salsum, vel ut elii dicunt fartum
selsifium.” Τ1ιο lettuce, Catius says, ought
not to be taken for this purpose, beoeuse it
does not settle on the stomach when it ie
irritetcd. 4 Lactuca’ was commonly eatan
ut the ⁸ gustator-ium ' aa en incentive to the
appetite. Pliny, speaking of the different
species of this plant, says ι 44 Est netum
omnibus resi-ige rati-ix, et ideo aestate gntae
stomacho fastidium auferunt cibique appe-
tentiam fnciunt '⁹ (xix. 38). Catius says the
cloyed stomuch would rather (malit) have
any course dish brought in from the cook-
chop to stimulate it than lettuce efter drink-
ing wine, which was a different thing from
taking it before dinner.

61. Flayitat immor-m refici, ·] ⁸Im-
moreus’ agrees with ‘stomachum' and
significa είςίιιιιιίιιιιοιί,4 p,'ervul.sus ee‘ ‘qualia
lassum pervellunt stolinechum” (S. 8. 9).
The older editione nearly all have ⁸in

the Royul Libra-y at Paris collated by
Pottier. probably arose out of the word

62. immundis fervent allata pupinia]
The⁸ popinne’ were the lowest sort of

timec nent out. They were the same es the
Greek καπηλεῖα. They were a lower sort
of‘ cauponne’ (see S. i. 5. 2, ιι..) Their
keepers‚ ‘fpopae were, as might be exi-
p,ected usually persons of no credit (⁸⁸1n
rebar enim credi popae? ’Cic. pro Mil. 24).
The shops were dii-ty, and the company
very low. Compare Epp. i. 14. 21:

“Fon-nix tibi et unctu popina Incutiunt
urbis desiderium. ’⁹ There were great num-
bers of thece chop e about the cityg whence

The⁸ popinae’ were called ‘thermopo ἤι’
