quz, bono claroque fidelis amice Neroni,

Si quis forte velit puerum tibi vendere natum

Tibure vel Gabiis, et tecum sic agat: ‘⁶ Hic et

Candidus et talos a vertice pulcher ad imos

Fiet eritque tuus nummorum millibus octo, 5
Verna ministeriis ad nutus aptus herilee,

Litterulis Graecis imbutuS, idoneus arti

Cuilibet3 argilla quidvis imitaberis uda;

Quin etiam canet indoctum sed dulce bibenti :

Multa fidem promissa levant, ubi plenius aequo

Laudat venales qui vult extrudere merces,
Res urget me nulla; meo sum pauper in aere.

1. Flore, bono claroque] See Introduc-
tion, and aa to the character of Tiberius see
Epp. i. 9. 4, n. His name was that of hir
father, Tiberine Claudius Nero, till his adop-
tion by Augustus, Aa). 4, when he became
Tib. Claudius Nero Caesar.

2. natum flaura vel Germia] Thnt ie,

‘any where γοα pleese! “Poetis certa ima-
gine opus est3⁹ ⁹the poete like ιο give reality
to their illustratione by being specific. This
ie Dillenbnrger⁹ e remark, and 1 agree with
him. Orelli thinks Italian towns are men·-
tioned with reference ιο the fact of the
slave being a ⁴ verna ⁹ (Epod. ii. 65, n.).

As to Gabii, see Epp. ἰ. ll. 7, n.

5. nummorum millibus octo,] About
651. sterling. Much larger eume were given
for handeome slaves, and thie boy’ e acoem-
plizhmente, if they were real, would make
him worth a good price. There would be
reason therefore to suspect iu such a ease
that the owner was anxious to get rid of
him. (See S. ii. 7. 43, n.) 'rho ‘literati’
were a seperate class in the slave family,
and were subdivided into ⁴ anagnostae ⁹ or
⁴ lectores ⁹ (who read to their masters, chiefly
at their meals, or if their masters were
authore they read their productione aloud
for the beneflt of the guests), and⁴ librarii’
or ‘scribam' ueed for writing stom dictation,

taldng care of the libr-ary, keeping muniz,
&c., and hence ealled‘ pueri⁹ or‘ servi aetu-
diisss ‘ab epistolis,⁹⁴ a bibliotheca,⁹⁴ notarii}
διο. There were aleo architecte, sculptum,
painters, engi-avere, and other amiate, who
all came under the eme general head of

‘lita-ati! The boy m this place might aleo
he put among the⁴ cantoree⁹ or ‘sympho-
niaci,⁹ the choir or band who sang aud
played to their master at meeis. In short,
he was fit for any of the above employmente
aocoedingtohie owner⁹e estimato, which he
professes to put' m a modest way, for seer he
should seem to be puffing his property, and
eo depreciate its velue.

12. meo eum pauper in aera] ‘Aee
alienum⁹ is used for a debt, and⁴ aee pro—
prium⁹ ⁴,auum ’δια ie therefore money not
bon-owed. Cicero op ppo-ee them (in Verr.
ii. 4. 6): “At hominem video auctionem
fecisse nullam3 vendidisse praeter fructus
euos nihil unquam, non modo m aere alieno
nullo, sed in suis nummis multis esee et
semper fuissefi “Aee alienum est quod
noe aliis ἀοδοιααες aee enum eet quod alii
nobis debent” (Dig. 50. 16. 213, quoted

by Mr.1.ong on the foregoing ).
The man here says he is not rich, ut what
he hae ιι his own.
