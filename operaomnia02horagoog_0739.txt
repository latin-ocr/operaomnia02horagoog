HORATII FLACGI

Defendet, neu quid medios intercinat ectus

Quod non proposito conducat et haereat apte.

' 195

Ille bonis faveatque et consilietur amice,

Et regat iratos et amet peccare timentes;
Ille dapes laudet mensae brevis, ille salubrem
J ustitiam legesque et apertis otia portis;

Ille tegat commissa deosque precetur et oret,

Ut redeat miseris, abeat fortuna superbis.
Tibia non ut nunc orichalco vincte tubaeque
Aemula, sed tenuis simplexque foramine pauco
Adspirare et adesse choris erat utilis atque

Nondum spissa nimis complere sedilia flatu3

edopts thet reading. I see no reason for
doing so. Tho office esa-ibed tothe chorus
by Horace is “s general expression of
moral sympathy‚ exhortation, instruction,
end werning,” which Schlegel considers the
beet description thet has been given. He
considers it ‘⁴ as a personified reflection on
the action that is going on ς the incorpora-
tion into the representation itself of the
sentiments of the poet es the spokesman of
the whole humen rece. The chorus is the
ideal spectator. It mitigetes the impression
of s beart-rending or moving story, while it
conveys to the actual spectator s lyrica! end
musical expression of his own emotions, end
elevatos him to the region of contempla-
tion ’¹ (Drem. Lit. Lect. ιζ. In plain
terms, the business of the c orus was to
atter such reflectione as any indifferent per-
sons might conceive on the action before
it, and to eddress those reflections to the
characters represented, es one might ed·
dress them to resi persons under the same
circumstances.

198. mensae brevis] Compare Epp. i.
14. 35, ‘⁴ coena brevis juvat3 ' end with
⁴⁸ apertis otia portis,” compare C. iii. 5. 23,
“ portusque non clauses,” representing e
picture of mtionsl security end pesce. The
chorus, to whom the principsl persons com-
municsoed their intended crimes end deepest
plote, were held to sem-ecy es a prime duty.
Thus Medea coolly tells the chorus her
intention to murder her children end her
rival, and reckons upon their καθιεῖ as s

matter of course. Other inshncoe ere nn-
merens.

The ⁴ tibin ’ was sn instrument originally
mede of s hollow reed (Pliny xvi. 36. 66),
or a box-wood pipe (Ovid, Fut. vi. 697), οι·
the sbin-bone of some enimsi, from which
the name is derived. After-uda it was
brought to greater perfectiori. and m
mede of ivory sometimes. It resembled
the flegeolet or clu-ionet. It was usual to
play two ⁴ tibine ’ together, es observed on
C. iv. 15. 3⁰, where see note. Theseia the
British Museum heve six holes. Pr0hably
in the days of Horace they had more. The
metal which the encients called ‘ orichalcum’
is unknown. It was not to be found even
in Pliny's time. The den-ivstion from the
Latin ⁴ aurum ⁹ md the Greek χαλκός is
etymologically absin-d, and the quantity of
the first syllable disproves it. The mom
probable derivetion is from ὄρος and χαλ-
κός, the meaning being ‘ mountain-bronze?
With this the parts of the ⁸ nbis: which
took to pieces ns our flutes do, were bound
st the joining-s. Bentley md others prefer
⁸ juncte,' which is the reading of the oldest
editions snd some MSS. The best heve

the ‘ tibin ’ servetl for en accompsniment to
the chorus, but esterwerds it cume to dmm
it. In those days the population of the city
was smeller, the thestroe less crowded, end
the sudienoe more reverentiel tud stteun’ve.
What times Horace elludes to it is difficult
to say. Orelli thinks his history of chon!
music is a „fanciful account, fluctneting won-
der-fully between the practice of the Greeks,
thet of the Romans, end thet which his own
{ginginsfion has drawn ς and this is perhaps

e cese.
