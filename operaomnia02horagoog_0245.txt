220 HORATII FLAOGI

CARMEN II.
A. σ. e. 738.

The fortunes of Iulus Antonius, son of the triumvir, his rise sud tragica end, do not
coucernthis ode. He was e mn ofletters und s pupil os L. Crassitius, e grammarian
who kept s school st Rome, to which many sons of the noble families were sent (see
Dict. Biog. Crassitius). He received therefore s good education, end we heve it on the
authority of the Scholiasta that he wrote en heroic poem ou the fortunes of Diomed, in
twelve books, besides some prose-works. Acron says thet his poem was excellent3 but, es
‘it is not likely he ever saw it, his testimony is not worth much. (See Heyne, Exc. Aen. x.
243.) Horace pays him the compliment of ssying thet he could celebrate Augustus· vic-
tories much better then himself, but this he said to Maecenas (C. ii. 12. 11); eud, though
from thet pesse-ge end this we may believe thet Maecenas wrote prose und Antonius
poetry, the quality of either sud the subjecte cannot be inferred from sny deta Horace
has given us. The Scholiasts write the neme ⁴ J ulius,' but ⁸ Iulus ⁹ is the correct form.
Because we know nothing of Antonius' poeticul powers except from this ode, and because
of the distance between the two names, ⁶ Iule' (v. 2) end ‘Antoni' (v. 26), some oeifioe have
changed ‘ Iule ' into ⁸ Ille ' (Peerlkamp. in loco Eichstsdt. Peredox. Horat. i. p. 9), end
supposed ⁴ Antoni' to mean Antonius Rufus, who is mentioned by Acron (on A. P. 289) sud
comm. Cruq. ss one who wrote comedy3 but the existence of such ι person is very doubt-
ful, though Suetonius mentions a grammarian of thet name, end Ovid speaks of one
Rufus who wrote lyric poetry aster the manner of Pindsr (Ex Pont. iv. 16. 27, sqq.) ι

“ Et qui Maeoniam Phaeacida vertitg et une
Pindaricae fidicen tu quoque, Rufe, lyrae.''

But there is no reason to suppose his nume was Antonius. In A.u.c. 737 the Sigambri,
with two other German tribes, crossed the Rhine end laid waste pert of the Romen
territory in Gaul. They defeated the legate Lollius, end this disaster was sufficient to
induce Augustus (Dion Cass„ 54. 19, intimatos thet he hed other reasons, especially his
personui unpopulsrity et Rome und his inti-ignes with Terentia, which is mere goesip)
to go in person to Gaul, which he did, end at his approach the Germsns withdrew into
their own territories, end giving hostsges obtuined pesce. The defeat of Lollius hed
caused great consternation st Rome, und the news of the barberisns' subjection was heiled
with proportionata joy. Augustus did not return for two years to Rome, having mesn-
while restored order in Germany, Gaul, und Spein3 but it is probable this ode was
written in the expectetion of his return und while the news respecting the Sigambri was
still fresh, thet is to sey, about the end of ,mu-c. 738. Augustus' return to Rome was
expected long before it took place (see C. 5 of this book). The general impression
derived from the ode is that Antonius· had pressed Horace to write s poem in honour of
Augustus' victory in the style of Pindsr’s ἐπινίκια, end thet he very wisely declined,
though his friend Titius (Epp. i. 3. 10) was more bold, end Rufus above mentioned was

sotoo.

ARGUMENT.

Whoso would rivel Pindsr must expect Icarus’ sete. His numbers roll like s swollen

river. His is the bey, whether he tune the dithyrsmb or sing of gods end heroes, of
victore or of women heresved. The swan of Dirce sosrs to the clouds = Ι em but es e

bee sipping the flowers oi' Tibur. Thou, Antonius, shalt sing os the triumphs of caesar,
greatest end best, end of the holidey rejoicings that hail his return: end 1 will edd my
small voice to thine= sud we will all sing songs of n-iumph sud will esci-ifice, thou with
bulis und cows, 1 with s young heifer.
