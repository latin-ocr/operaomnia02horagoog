HORATII FLAGGI

Quum veto te fieri vappam jubeo ac nebulonem.

Est inter Tanain quiddam socerumque Viselli.

105

Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines,
Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.
Illuc unde abii reden, nemo ut avarus

Se probet ac potius laudet diversa sequentes,

Quodque aliena capella gerat distentius uber

110

Tabescat‚ neque se majori pauperiorum

Turbae comparet, hunc atque hunc superare laboret.
Sic festinanti semper locupletior obstat,

Ut, quum carceribus missos rapit ungula currus,

Instat equis auriga suos vincentibus, illum

Praeteritum temnens extremos inter euntem.
Inde fit ut raro qui se vixisse beatum

Dicat, et exacto contentus tempore vita
Cedat uti conviva satur, reperire queamus.

⁸ fronfibus adversis ⁹ with ⁴ pugnantia,' but it be that no eovstous man, &c. ’⁹ That

that would appear to mean that the man does not read pleasantly.

But Lambinus,

was reconciling two things at issue with one Bentley, Fen, Heindorf, and many others

another, which is not Horace's meaning.

104. vappam] ‘⁶ Vappa hic dicitur per·
ditus et luxuriosus, stultus, innuens, qui
nihil sspit3 avlno corrupto et muido quod
saporem perdidit. Nebulones autem vani
et leves ut nebulse; nam cum sine certo con-
silio vitam degant nebulis sunt et umbris
hominum similes.’' These are tbe clear
definitione given by Cruquius' Commen-
tator.

10⁶. stacia—socerumque Vincla] An
thatcanbesaidofthese snowis
contained in the words of Porphyrion and
Comm. cruq. The words of the latter are
‘⁸ Tanais spado fixit, Maecenatis libertusg at
Visellii socer herniosus 3'’ and Porphyrion
adds that some say he was a freedman of
L. Munatius Plancus. He also says that
Horace has conveyed under these names a
well-known Greek proverb.

108. mouturam] ‘Ireturutothst
point from whence 1 have digreseed, how
that no covetous man is satisfied with him-
self! 1 adopt this reading with some mis-

appears (Fea says) in the Editio Princeps
printed at Milan in 1476. It is in the
Venetian edition of 1483, and some of
Cruquins' MSS„ and some others referred
to by Fea. The beet ΜΒ. reading is
⁸ nemon’,' which would imply that Horace
hed broken out again, as at the first, ⁸⁶ can

have ‘ nemon⁸ ς’ -and Heindorf argues, stom
the harshness of the madon, that the
San‘re is an early production3—a bed argu·
ment. Other readings there are, as ⁴ nemo
ut sit avarus' (which was that of the
Scholiasts), ‘qui nemo ut avarus ;' but they
do not give a dear meaning. ⁶ nodamus:
or ⁴ redeundum) would get rid of the diffi-
culty; but they have no authority. Ι do
not
the hiatusin this plaeewhich has ledto
the above corrections is ‘⁶ ineptus timor.”
1 de not like it at all. Horace qualifies
the generalassertionhe madeattheoubet
by limiting his remark to the avaridous.
See note onv.28; and on ‘laudet’ seev. ³.

110. Quodque aliem capella] This Por-
phyn'on calls a proverbial eaying, quoting
ovid (Α. Α. i. 349);--

“ Fertilior seges est alienis semper in agris ς
Viffltssffqm pecus grandius uber ha-

¹¹.⁴¹· Ut, quum carceribus] See Intro-
dml'tllglbc'edat uti conviva rutum] These
are so like the words of Lucretius (iii. 951),
that perhaps Horace remembered them
when he wrote—-

‘⁴ eur non ut plenus vitae conviva re-
Aemminimoque capis moram, stulte,
quietem .²”
