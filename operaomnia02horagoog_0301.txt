Turdis edacibus dolos,

Pavidumque leporem et advenam laqueo gruem 35
J ucunda captat praemia.
Quis non malarum quas amor curas habet

Haec inter obliviscitur?

Sabina qualis aut perusta solibus

Perniois uxor Apuli,

Sacrum vetustis exstruat lignis focum

Lassi sub adventum viri,

Donec in angustam ceciderunt undique val-
Inll‘iand vicem stupuere greges, socioque
Μξιιῗιῗοῗσιιιιις simul hirtus aper, simul ursa,

Cogitur, et captos contemnit cerva leones.”

Plutarch, in his life of Alexander speaks
of toils twelve miles long. The poete,
Latin and Greek, used the feminine gender
in speaking of hunting- dogs, as mares
are more osten mentioned than horses
for the rece. ‘Amites⁹ were forked stskes
on which the nets were stretched. ⁴ Plagae⁹
were the strong nets mentioned above;
‘retia’ were finer ones for birds and fish·
⁴ retia ιιι-ε’ were those with wider meshes
than fishing -,nets and therefore used only
for birds. gEdauffius' represents their de·
predations on the σοι-ιι, which 1 mention
because Doering applioe it to their greedy
seizure of the hait. The next line is said

of the hare and crans. If so, Doering con-

trives to annihilato the poet⁹s purpose by
