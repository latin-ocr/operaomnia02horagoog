44 HORATII FLAOCI

CARMEN XVII.

It may entertain the reader ιο know that a treatise was once written on the subject of
Horace's Tyndaris, in which it was proved to the satisfaction of the writer that she was
,a freedwoman of Rhaemetalces, king of Thrace, that she is the person Horace elsewhere
speaks of as Thressa Chloe, Sidonia Chloe, and Venus Marina3 also that she was a
poetess. It being assumed that the last ode was addressed to Tyndaris, according to the
common inscriptions, it is supposed by many that the lovers had made up their quan-el,
and that Horace here proposes a meeting to seul their reconciliation. All this which is
plainly unreasonable should be put asida by any who wish to understand Horace. 'rhem
is no connexion between the two odes, except that the title, which belongs ιο this, has
been horrowed for the other, and there is no reason to suppose that Horace, writing at
his farm, had any other than an imaginat-y Tyndaris, with an imaginary Cyrus, in his
mind.

ARGUMENT.

Tyndaris, osten deth Pan leave Lycaeus ιο visit Lucretile, protecting my ilocks from
sun and wind ς my goats go unharmed and fear not snake or wolf when his ποθι pipe
sounds in the vale of Ustica. The gods love me for my piety and my muse. Here
Plenty awaits thee3 here shalt thou retire from the heat and sing of the loves of Pene-
lope and Circe for Ulysses. Here thou shaIt quaff mild Lesbian in the shade, nor shall
strife be mingled with the cup, nor shalt thou foer the jedous Cyrus, lest he lay his
violent hand upon thee.

VELox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
Mutat Lycaeo Faunus et igneam
Defendit aestatem capellis
Usque meis pluviosque ventos,
Impune tutum per nemus arbutos 5
Quaerunt latentes et thyma deviae
Olentis uxores mariti,

Nec virides metuunt colubras
Nec Martiales Haediliae lup08‚

l. Lucretilem] ‘ Mons Lucretilis’ is Horace’s estate and the bare rocks that
identified by De Chaupy and others with here and there show themselves, thinks he

the lofty mountain (or range) called Monte
Genuam, that overhangs the valley of the
Licenza—-Horace's Digentia (Epp. i. 18.
104),—in which his estate lay. De Chaupy
gives a very agreeable account of the
scenery, to shew that it was ‘⁶ un sejour
plein d’attraits pour le Dieu Pan,'’ a place
to which Faunus might well resort fr0m his
Arcadian home Lycaeus. Ustica, the Scho-
liasts say, was a mountain or a mountain
and valley. Acron favours the latter, inter-
preting ‘ cubantis ’ by ⁶ depressae! Prophy-
rion, on the other hand, and Comm. Cruq.
refer the epithet ‘ ad resupinam regionem
ejus.’ De Chaupy, who illustratos ‘
sonuere saxa’ by the echoes he himself
heard on the spot, which he identifies with

can also fix upon this spot Ustica on the
slope of the hilis, and he therefore does not
allow Acron's interpretation of ⁴ cubantis!
But it must be a matter of conjecture.—
The construction with ⁴ mutel ‘permuto,’
by which the remoter object becomes the
nearer, is not peculiar to Horace, but it
will be found ιο occur several times in his
works. Virg. Georg. i. 8: “ Chaoniam
pingui glandem mutavit arista.” Ἀλλάσ·
σειν, ἀμείβειν also admit of this double oon-
struction, sometimes the thing given in ex-

change being in the accusative, sometimes
the thing taken. See Heindorf on S. ii.
