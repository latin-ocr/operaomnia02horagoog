Quid sentire putas? quid eredis, amice, precari?

EPISTLE xlx, '

It would appear that Horace had imit-tora, among those who obused him3 and if π
ure to understand him to menn what he mys, there were those who took his oeuvivhl
odes men-any, and, ooupling them with the example of the old Greek poets, ooueeived
that the way to write verses was to propitiato Bocchus and drink a gre-‚t deul of vine.
But perhaps he only means that they took to writing in the sume amin nil about wine
md driving dull oui-e away, and so forth, which at second hand would be very poor staff.
Such servile imitators he spenks of with great disgust3 and, while he expones their
shallowness, he accounts for their malevolenoe towards himself by the fact of his not
having sought their company or hired their appianae. He st the same time clnims to
have been the first to dress the lyric mensures in the Latin hugum, while he defends
himself for having adopted the meu-es of another by pointing to the example· of Sappho
sud Alcaeus, and take· credit for having avoided the virulouoe of Archilochus while he
imitated his verse. This is introduced by the way, the chief purpose of the Epistie being
to show the folly of his calumniatore and the muse of their abnue.

There is no allusion to any of his poema but the Epodes sud Odes3 the publication
of tho latter probably brbught out the imitation· und the abnue referred to, und 1 think
