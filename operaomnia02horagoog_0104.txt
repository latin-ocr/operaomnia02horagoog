“ Sive in extremos penetrabit Inuus—m

mosque Britannos.”

Bentley obj0cts to ‘ultimos orbis) and

. proposes ⁸ oro ’ for ‘ orbis.' He thinks the

apro-uon barb-rous, but admits that Vir-gil
wrote ⁴ extremique hominum Morini '
(Aen. viii. 727), which is sufficieutly like
Horacs’s phrase. Cnnninghsm proposes
⁶ ultimi! But the MSS. do not vary. Tbey
all have ⁴ ultimos orbis! Lucan (viii. 541)
has ‘extremique orbis Iberi,' where how-
ever Bentley says ‘ exn-emi ' is the genitive
ense.

³0. diffusas retusum] This must have

⁴0

been the reading of the Scholiasts, of whom
Acron says, “ Drffinqas, connisum reformes,
nam et sicut finqere formare dicitur, sic et
diffinyere est uassatum reformare. Retu-
nmi, civilibus llis hebetatum ;” and Por-
phyrion: ‘⁸ nt ferrum quod retudimus in
corporibus nostrorum bello civili diffingas
(i. e. refabriees) adversus Barbaros.” This
gives a very good meaning3 but ⁴ diffingas'
is a word met within no author but Horace,
who uses it here and iu C. iii. 29. 47:
⁴⁸ neque diffinget infectumque reddet.''
ΜΒ. authority on words eompounded with
‘di' aud‘de’ is nottobetrusted.as before
observed C. i. 1. 13). Some MSS. of good
character ve ‘defingas’ and some ‘recu-
sum! Bentley adopts ⁸ defingas.’ saying
that nothing can be more alien from Horaee's
magn tm? nm. ξε
gives to ⁸ defingas' he does not say. For
⁶ retusum' he proposes ⁴ recoctum out of
his own head, thereby lesing one of the
chief points in the sentence, viz. the blunt-
22230312 &icamiam
v. p. 34⁹6). ⁶ Rae-usum incude’ is justly
objected to. The MSS. are in the propor-
tion of four to one in favour of ‘ diffingas
retusum ς’ and an the old editions have
that reading. Lambinus can make nothing
of it, and proposed first ⁴ desen-iuga& and
then ἔπῃ later edition ⁴ defigas’ with ‘ re-
mum.

CARMEN XXXVI.
About Anac. 730.

who Numida was we have no means of kuowing. That his gentilician name was
Plotius is stated by Comm. Cruq.‚ while the other Scholiasta, Acron and Porphyrion, call
him Pomponius. But Numida appears to have been a cognomen of the Plotia or Plautia
gens (aee Βοιώ, Prosop. p. 480). That he was au intimate friend of Horace's appears from
this ode. He was also a great friend of Ianiia’s (sec Ο. 26 of this book). Baxter sup-
pesas him to have been one of Pompey’s party, and to have returned to Rome from fol-
lowing Sextus in Spain with Anguem’ pan-don, which he infers from the unusual joy
Horace expresses. Buttmann seems to give, whether desig-nedly or not 1 cannot ten.
