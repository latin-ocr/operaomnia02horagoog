’ 24 HORATII FLAGGI

GARMEN VII.

Munatius Plancus, who followed Julius Caesar bothin Gaul and in his war with Pompey‚
after Caesar's death attached himself to the republican party, but very soon aflaerwards
joined Augustus3 then followed Antony to the east, and A.u.c. 722, the year before
Actium, j0ined Augustus again. It is supposed that about this time, perhaps at the
suggestion of Augustus, who was anxious to secure Plancus and ω keep him from
leaving Italy, Horace wrote him this ode while his mind was perplexed and he was per-
haps meditating retirement from Rome to Greeee.

1 think all this is very doubtful, and with Estre (p. 308) Ι cannot but think it uncer-
tain whether this Plancus is intended st all. It may have been his son, who is probably
the Munatius referre i to in Epp. i. 3. 31, or some other Plancus. But even if the father
be the man, 1 cannot see any such serious purpose in the ode as the above theory
imphes, nor do 1 believe Augustus attached any such value to the renegade's assistance.
He appears to have been a contemptible person. That the temple of Janus was not
closed at ὼε time is true (v. :0); but that does not fix the date before the battle of
Actium. 1 think the name of Plancus is again used more as a convenience than any thing

else, though there is perhaps a little more individuality given to this ode than the fourth.
'rho story of Teucer has all the appearance of a Greek origin.

Munatius Plancus, above referred to, was consul in A.11.c. 712. See C. ii1.14. 27,

“ Non ego hoe ferrem, calidus juventa,
Consule Planco.''

ARGUMENT.

Let others sing of the noble cities of (Ji-eece, and dedicate their lives to the eelebration
of Athens and all its glories. For my part Ι care not for Lacedaemon and Larissa,
as for Albunea’s eave, the banks of Anio, and the woods and orohards of 'fibula The
sky is not always dark, Plancus—drown care in wine, whether in the camp or iu
the shades of Tibur. As Teucer, though driven from his father's home, bound
poplar on his head and cheered his companions, saying, ‘⁶ Let us follow fortune, my
friends, kinder than a father: despair not while Teucer is your chief ς Apollo has pro-

mised us another Salamis: drown care in wine, for to-morrow we will aeek the deep
once mered! .
