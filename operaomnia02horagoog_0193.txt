Donec non alia magis

HORATII FLAOOI

Arsisti neque erat Lydia post Chloen,

Multi Lydia nominis

Romana vigui clarior Ilia.
Me nunc Thressa Chloe regit

Dulces docta modos et citharae scienS,

10

Pro qua non metuam mori
Si parcent animae fata superstiti.

Me torret face mutua

Thurini Calais filius Ornyti,

Pro quo bis patiar mori

1⁵

Si parcent puero sata superstiti.
Quid si prisca redit Venus
Diductosque jugo cogit ae'neo,

Si flava excutitur Chloe
Rejectaeque patet janua Lydiae?

20

Quamquam sidere pulchrior
Ille est, tu levior cortice et improbo

Iracundior Hadria,

Tecum vivere amem, tecum obeam libens.

5. alia] Some MSS. have ‘aliaml which
Bentley adopts, thinking it more likely the

have inserted it. Orelli thinks just the re-
verse. Either construction is correct (see
C.' 1i. 4. 7, ιι.). Οιι4 ‘multi nominisl see
C. i. 36. 13.

12. sa· parcent animae]
(xiv. 14)·4 ‘Vos meae carissimae animae

are the present subjunctive, 4 parcent? fol-
lowing those words, should, in strict Lati-
nity, be‘ parcant! But the same construc-
tion occurs above (C. iii. 3. 7) :--

“ Si fuctus illabatur orbis,
Impavidum ferient ruinse,''

cio. ad Fam.

where, however, some MSS. have 4 illabetur!
Why chloe should be a Thracium, and Orny-
tus a Sybarite (Thurium was formerly Sy-
baris) is not worth questioning. 'rho reading
Cressa is properly rejected as harsh, and

Ornithi, which could only be derived stom
ὄρνιθος. of which the penult is long. Both
seem to have got intop the Scholiasts’ text
only through the error of transoeibers.

17. prisea] Forcellini gives other in-
stances of this use of‘ priscus, ’‘where pris·
tinus' is more usual. ⁴,Deductos' the read-
ing of the oldest Berne and one Leipzig
MS. quoted by J am could only be taken
with‘ jugp,’ and sighify ‘withdrawn from
the yoke,’ which might bc admitted hya
double oonsnuction of‘ Jugo’ with* deduc-
tos' and 4 cogit.' I have given the common
reading, but the other hardly desei-ves Orel-
li's strong condemnation.

19. excutitur] Bentley undet-stands 4 js-
nua’ from the next line, following Act-on,
who says, 44 Excutitur: pro expellitur.”
Orelli says it is ιι metaphor taken from a
horse that throws its rider. The English
“cast off” expresses the meaning best.
On the meaning of ‘improbus’ as s word
expressing ‘excess,’ see below (C. iii. 24. 62).
