. HORATII FLAGOI

Quid deceat, quid non, obliti, Caerite cera
Digni, remigium vitiosum Ithacensis Ulixei,
Oui potior patria fuit interdicta voluptas.

Si, Mimnermus uti censet, sine amore jocisque

62. &erite cera Diqm'‚] Caere (Cer-
vett-i) was a very ancient town of Etruria,
about twenty-seven miles north of Rome.
It was <ailad by the Greeks Ἀγύλλα.
About mmo. 40⁰, the people of Tarquinii
having taken up arms against the Ro-
mans, the Caerites were accused of aiding
them, and were threatened with punish-
ment, but having asked pardon they ob-
tained it at the expense- of half their
territory. They were also granted the Ro-
man franchise without the ⁴ s 'um ' or
right of voting for magistrates. t is dis·
puted whether this was given them on the
occasion last mentioned, in which case it
would appear more as a punishment than a
reward; or on the retirement of the Gauls
before the destruction of Rome, on which
occasion they rendered important service.
Gellius says it was at this latter time
(xvi. 13), and he says they were the first
that received the franchise in ‘thia form
‘⁸ sine suffragii jure.” Porphyrion says dis-
finctly this limited franchise was laid upon
them as a disgrace, ‘⁶ victis Caeritibus Ro-
mani in percutiendo foedere ‘non dederunt
suffragii fruendi jus, quod ignominiosum
fuit.” Acron says, ‘⁴ Caerites populi sunt
quos cum vicissent Romani, statuerunt ut
nunquam leges ederent nec leges haberent,
gili-gd multum ignominiosum fuit.” (Jomm.
thoni· ῒεῖἒῗιῗέ ¹3:¹13ss ἊίὶΠωΞὲἰΓῖἲὶι ῗὲιίἓ
they had forfeited it, the Romans restored
it without the ‘jus suffragii,’ which how-
ever would be no great loss if they had the
'⁸ commercium’ and ⁸ connubium.’ ‘ Caeritum
cerae,' or ‘ tabulae,' would mean properly
a register of the inhabitante of Caere, who
would of course be registered when they
came into the above relation to Rome. But
it seems probable that at this time the name
had a conventional meaning, and applied to
the registers of all those who were in the
position of ⁴ aerarii,' that is, of the citizens
of such towns as had not the perfect fran-
chise, and of those citizens who had for any
cause been degraded from their tribes (see
Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. ii. 673 iii. 85).
“ Tabulae Caerites appellatae in quas een-
ωηο referri jubebant quos notae eausa suf-
fragiis privabant ’' (Gen. ubi sup.). As-

“Ut qui senator esset ejiceretur aenatug
qui eques Romanus equum publicum per-
deret3 qui plebeius in Caeritum tabulas
referretur, et aerarii fieret, ac per hoc nen
essetin albo centuriaesuae,sed ad hoc esset
civis tantum, ut pro capite suo tributi nomine
aera penderet.” Thus Horace means that
they who took such a low view of life were
n‘ot worthy of being Roman citizens, being
more on an equality with the crew of
Ulysses, whom Circe turned to swine (Epp.
2. 23, n.), and who slew and eat the kine
sacred to the Suu, though they swore they
would not, and their return home depended
on their oath being kept. See Odyss. xi.
105, squq xii. 303, ιφ, 34⁰, sqq. ‘Bae-
migium is used for the rewers, as ‘man-
cipium,’ ‘servitium,’areusedforaslave‚and
many other words are used in the same
way.

65. Si, Mimnermus uta· censen] Horace
was familiar, we may be sure, with the
writings of Mimnermus, the elegiae poet
of Smyrna. He preferred him to Calli-
machus, as appears from Epp. ii. 2. 99, sqq.
His poen-y is of a melancholy cast, as far
ζῷ’ {3233222513202 ἒξ, seih& {3²33
was their principal theme and the only
remedy he recognizes for the ills of life, it
does not seem as if he was very happyin
his experience of it. One fragment. pre-
served in Stobaeus (Florileg- 63. 16, Fr. l,
Bergk), bears out what Horace says. He
may have had many such passages in his
mind. It begins,—

ric δὲ βίος, τί δὲ τερπνὸν ἄτερ χρυσέης
Ἀφρθὸἱτηςε ⁶ ,
τεθναίην ὅτε μοι μηκέτι ταυτα palo«,

κ.τ.λ.

Horace adds ‘ jocisque) as elsewhere he
makes Joous the companion of Venus (C. i.
Ξί. &infin-operum says of Mimnermus

‘⁸ Plus in amore valet Mimnermi versus
cffiffirssinmetu, lenia quaerit amor.”

Porphyrion's note appears to be derived
from some information he and we
do not, and it is worth adding: “Mim-
nermus elegans scriptor fuit, qui in quadam
ecloga Hieronymi secum commendans
