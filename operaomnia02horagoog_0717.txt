HORATII FLAOOI

Quaedam, si credis consultis, mancipat usus;

Qui te pascit ager tuus eet, et villicus Orbi,

Cum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturae,

Te dominum sentit.

Das ιιιιιιιιιιοε, accipis uvam,

Pullos, ova, cadum temeti: nempe modo isto
Paulatim mercaris agrum fortasse trecentis

Aut etiam supra nummorum millibus emptum. ·

Quid refert vivas numerato nuper an olim?
Emptor Aricini quondam Veientis et arvi

Dict. of Antiquities, ert. ⁸ Mancipium ⁹2.
A third person held ι pair of scales (⁸ libra )
which the purchaser touched with ι piece of
ffing, st the same fimlihnff Ῑιίειξιιιᾶ petz
mg purchased cco ιιι ι
form of words he claimed the thing ss his
own, sud handed the money to the seller ss
ι misen of the sum agreed upon. This
form of purchase was called⁸ ‘mancipatiol
The seller was suid⁸ mancipio dare' ,(ΐο
which‘ mancipare' in this place is equiva-
lent). and the purchsser was said⁸ mancipio
⁸occipere. ⁹ When property of the nature of
‘res mancipii⁹ came into ι ιιιιιι’ s possession
without tho regular forms of⁸ mancipati&
01¹⁸ injure cessio ⁹(both ofwhichareex-
plsined ιιι the Dict. of Anti quities), he was
not owner ⁸ ex jure Quiritium ⁹ until he be-
came so by ⁸ usucapi0,⁹ that is, by having
beon in possession for ι certain time, vary-
ing according ss the things were‘ res man-
cipi' or not. 11· no one claimed owner-
ship in it before the expiration of that
time, he who had it became owner, as
much ss if he hsd received it by⁸ menci-
patio! Hence⁸ usus' is suid⁸ mancipare,
because the effect is the ssme whether a
ιιιιιι ‘possidendo usucapiat’ or ‘mancipio
accipiet! (See Dict. Ant.. srts. ⁸Domi-
nium,⁹ ‘Muncipiumss ‘in J ure cessio?
‘Usucapim ⁹) But⁸ usus ’here means thst
sort of possession which consiste in the
enjoyment of the fruita by paying for them.

161. ctam κροκι occat] Cicero says
(Cat.Maj.c.16) ‘quse (terra) cum
gremio mollito sc subacto sparsum semen
excepit, primum id occoecatum cohibet, ex
quo occatio quae hoc efficit nominate oetss’

old word, signifying ‘wine.⁹ 4491ιί de

“carent temeto omnes mulieroefl though
the word was probably not common in his

day. Plautus uses it, and Juvenal. (See

167. Emp tor Aricini quondm] The
MSS. have different ‘quonium’

the first sppears to have most authority
from MSS. All those of Cruquius, Torren-
