CARMEN VIII.

ΑΗ that is known of C. Mardus Censorinus, the person to whom this ode is addressed,
may be found in Smith's Dict. Biog. (Censorinus, 6). He was n men of birth und
educetion, aud much beloved, according to Velleius, who says of his death, ⁴⁴ Graviter
tulit civitus.” Horace pays him the compliment of believing thet he would esteem un
ode of his more highly than any costly εἰπε he could offer in accordunce with the com-
mon practice among friends of making each other preseuts (strenas) on new-year's day
end other festivals. We heve no means of determining when the ode was written. But
see C. iv. Β, Introduction.

ARGUMENT.

If 1 were rich in statues und pictures, 1 would give such to my friends, und the best to thee,
Censorinus. But Ι heve none, eud thou desii-est not these. What Ι have 1 offer,—
verses in which thou delightest. No monuments of mei-hle, not their own mighty deeds
could ennoble the Scipiones like Ennius' verses. Thine own virtues must remaiu obscure
but for the muse. What would Aeacus or Romulus heve been without her? She
rsises men to the skies, es she did Hercules, the Tyndaridae, and Liber.

Domuum pateras grataque commodus,
Censorino, meis aera sodalibus,

Donarem tripodes, praemia fortium

Graiorum, neque tu pessima munerum

Feri-ee, divite me scilicet artium 5
Quas aut Parrhasius protulit aut Scopae,

Hic sax0, liquidis ille coloribus

Sollers nunc hominem ponere, nunc deum.

Sed non haec mihi viS, non tibi talium

Res est aut animus deliciarum egene. 10
Gaudes carminibus ; carmina possumus

Donare et pretium dicere muneri.
