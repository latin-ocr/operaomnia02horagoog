224 HORATII FLAGOI

received probably with so much favour as to draw forth this ode. That is at any rate a
reasonable way of determining its date, which otherwise must remain wholly unknown.
The ode has all the appearance of genuine feeling, and shows bow much Horace bad suf-
fered from the vexatione detractions that at one time be was subject to. Ssnadon
declares it is 44 perfect-ly beautifu1,” and Dacier says 44 rien de plus acheve‚” nothing more

finished, is to be found in the Greek or Lstin language. Julius Scaliger would rather ·

beve written it than have been king 44 totius Tarraconensis-'⁹ 1 confess there is no ode tint
strikes me as more terse or more elegantly written than this. It is much less artificia!
than the first ode of the first book with which it is usually compared.

ARGUMENT.

“ He οιι whom thou lookest at bis birth, Melpomene, derives bis fame, not from the gamem

or from triumphs, but from the streame and woods of Tibur inspiring him with Aeolia'n
song. They have named me the tuner of the Roman lyre, and envy mults me no '
longer ns it did ς and to thee 1 owe this giss: of pleasing, Ο Muse, who rulest the theu,
and art able to give the music of the swan to the voioeless flsh if thou wilt.

QUEM tu, Melpomene, semel
Nascentem placido lumine videris,
Illum non labor Isthmius
Glarabit pugilem, non equus impiger
Curru ducet Achaico ⁵
Victorem, neque res bellica Deliis
Ornatum foliis ducem,
Quod regum tumidas contuderit minaS,
Ostendet Capitolio:
Sed quae Tibur aquae fertile praefluunt ιο
Et spissae nemorum comae
Fingent Aeolio carmine nobilem.
Romae principis urbium
Dignatur suboles inter amabiles
Vatum ponere me choros, 15
Et jam dente minus mordeor invido,
O, testudinis aureae
