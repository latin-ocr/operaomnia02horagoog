Tu mihi qui imperitas alii servis miser atque

Duceris ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.

Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens sibi qui imperiosus,
Quem neque pauperies neque mors neque vincula terrent,

Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores

Greeks called vevpdevraorov). 'rho ancients
carried their mechanicel slnll in the con-
struction of automaton figures as far, and
perhaps fax-ther, than it has been carried
since. A celebrated instance is that of
Claudius’ eham-fight in the lacus Fu “ us,
during which a figure of Triton in s ver
rose up from the lake and blew n blant upon
n trumpet (Sueton. Vit. Claudii, c. 21).
Artists in this line were common among
the Greeks, and were called νευρόσπασται,
σύτοματουργοὶ. It appears from Herodo-
tus (ii. ⁴8) that ἀγάλματα νευρόσπαστα,
ω he cells them, were in use among the
Egyptians. The instance he gives is very
filthy. Plato (de Logg. lib. i. p. 644) speaks
of mm’s passione ns Davus does: τόδε δὲ
ἴσμεν, ὅτι ταῦτα τὰ πάθη ἐν ἡμῖν οἷον
νεῦρα ἣ μήρινθοὶ τινες ἐνοῦσαι σπῶσί τε
ἡμᾶς καὶ ἀλλήλαις ἀνθέλκουσιν knivam
οὖσαι ἐπ’ ἐναντίας πράξεις. Persius has
imitat3d this passage like many others (S.
v. 129 ε

“ ——- Sed si intus etin jecore aeg-ro
Nascuntur domini, qui tu impunitior exis
Atque hie, quem ud strigiles scutica et metus

egit herilis ?'’

83. cibi qui imper-foma ⁸ He who hes
control over himself! Before Horace no
writeruses thiswordwith a cese aster it.
Pliny uses the genitive, Seneca the dative,
aster ‘imperiosus ’ in tho places quoted by
Porcellini.

85. Respomare equinam] ⁴ Responso’
is repeated in v. 103 (where however see
note), and Epp. i. 1, 68. “Fortunae respon-
sare supa-haee· It seems to mean, to reply to
on equnl terme, and so to be ι match for, and
to overcome. The construction of the adjec-
five and infinitivo is common in the Odes, but
not in the Satires or Epistles. See C. i. l.

n.
¹633& in ce ipso tatur, memetque rotundum]
⁴ In himself entire, smoothed, and rounded,
that is, perfect as n sphen, and, as the
next line explains, like n beautiful statue
whose greces are nll in itself, which is per-
fectly finished and polisbed. This is else-
where expressed by ‘ ad unguem fuctus

homo' (S. i. ὅ. 32, ιι), the differ-enee in
the mode of expression being, thet here it
is meent there ere no inequalities on the
surhceon whiohnnything nt au oenrest.
The other expression has been explained
in its place. ‘Justus homo’ signifies α
complete or perfect men. ⁸ In seipso totus’
is explained by a similar passage in Cicero
(Paradox. ii.)= “Non potest non beatis-
simus esse qui totus aptus est, ex sene qui
in sc uno sua ponit omnia-'⁹ He want-s
nothing from without to set him off, and
his resources ns well aa his are all in
himself. The mud through which he puseo
as he goes through the world does not ud-
here to him; circumstances, prosperous m·
the reverse, do not effect his ὤκιστα-ς and
in all her mults upon his hnppineoe For-
tune proves but feeble, not being able to
make any impression upon it. ⁶ Mmcus’
means lame in the hand, ns ⁸ claudus ⁹ does
in the foot (see Foroell.). Ausonius bns
imitated Horace (Idyn. xvi.), end his words
illustrate these :—

⁸⁸ Vir bonus et sapiens, qualem vix repperit
Milli'm‘ltiu's¹ e multis hominum consultus
Ὶυὲεξοιίιζὲο sui totum se explorat nd un-
Qutigeglroceres venique ferat quid opinio
Secvxlrffs, mundi instar habens teres atque
Exrtztrliissuge quid labis per levia sidat-’³
Here ⁸ rotundus' is explained by the likeneoe
of the heavens, which Plato (Tim. p. 33)
says the Deity σφαιροειδὲς stupunico-ro,
as being most nster his own image. A
parallelogram wns also nn illustratiou of the
encients for a perfect man, taken from that
seying of Simonides in the ent quoted
by Plato in his Protagoras . 339), and
thus restored by Hermum :—

dvdp' ἀγαθὸν μὲν ἀλαθέως γενέσθαι χα-
χερὲίενπ 21,καί ποσὶ καὶ νοῳ

τετραῖγωνον, ἄνευ ψόγου τε·

τυγμενον.
