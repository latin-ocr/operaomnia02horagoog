Defer3 nil Grosphus nisi verum orabit et aequum.
Vilis amicorum est annona bonis ubi quid deest.

Ne tamen ignores quo sit Romana loco res :

Cantaber Agrippae, Claudi virtute Neronis
Armenius cecidit3 jus imperiumque Phraates
Caesaris accepit genibus minor; aurea fruges
Italiae pleno defundit Copia cornu.

23. emm] See above (Epp. 7. 98, ιι.).

24. Vilis amicorum ert annona] Horace
means to say good friends are cheaply
bought because they do not ask more than
is right, they are reasonable and modest' ιιι
their demands, as Grosphus would be.
Socrates m Xenophon (Mem. ii. lo), exhort-
ing Diodorus to the dutiae of friendship, says.
νῦν δὲ διὰ τὰ πράγματα dswvora'rovc' εστι
φίλους ἀγαθοὺς κτήσασθαι, in consequence
of the troubles of the times friends may be
bought cheap.

tion.

27. Armenius cecidit ,·] This is an ex-
aggerated way of stating the case. He
refers to the completion of Tiberius’ mis-
sion mentioned in the Introduction to Epp-
3. At their own request Augustus sent
Tigranes to the Armenians, he having been
for some time living in exile at Rome. They
put the reigning king Artaxias to death and
received Rgranes, because they had chosen
to have him for their king. Nevertheless
it appears that a coin was struck for the
occasion with the inscription anaema
carra,

— jus imperiumque Phraates] The re-
storation of the standards of Crassus took
place mmc- 734. The account of Justin,

noted in the Introduction to C. i. 26,

oes not state the case accurately as
regards this transaction, and the causes
which led to the remi-ation are so variously
stated by the histor-iaus that it is difficult
to form any opinion from their statements.
Suetonius (Aug. c. 21) merely says:

“Parthi quoque et Armeniam vindicanti
facile cesserunt (which refers to a later
affair), et signa militaria, quae M. Crasso et
M. Antonio ademerant, reposcenti reddide-
runt. obsidesque· insuper obtulerunt.n Ta-
citus (Anu. ii. l) says. “Phraates quan-
quam depulisset exercitus ducesque Ro-
manos, cuncta venerantium officia ad Au-
gustum verterat partemque prolis firmandae
amicitiae miserat, hand perinde nostri metu

uam fidei popularium diffisus.” It suited

e Romans to make the most of the con-

cessione of the Parthian king, and the re-
covery of the standards, which was probably
an act of policy independent of any sear
of Roman invasion, was proclaimed as a
triumph and recorded upon coins with the
inscription srcms ascerus. Horace al-
ludes to the circumstance not only here but
in C. ir. 15. 6, where the standards are
represented as torn down from the proud
walls of the Parthiansg and in Epp.' 1. 18.
56, where the same fiction is repeated.
That Augustus was particularly anxious to
hide the fact that the Parthians were not
afraid of him may be infel-red from the
frequent asserfion that they were so. (See
C.iv.5. 25; C. S. 53, sq.; S.ii. 5.62;
Epp. ii. l. 256.) On the ‘Monumentum

Anmncyrsn ’(p. 35, sd. Franz. quoted by
Orelli) Augustus recorda that he compelled
the Parthians to restore the spoils and
standan-ds of three Roman armies, and to
seek as suppliants the friendship of the
Romans. What Horace here says is, that
Phraates accepted or put himself under the
ing himself at his kneoe (¹ genibus {hinor’ ⁹),
—a ridiculous exaggeration. Ovid is nearly
as strong (Trist. ii. 227).

“Nunc petit Armenius pacem, nunc por-
rigit arcus
Parthus eques timida captaque signa

and again (Fast- vi. 465, sqq.)=

“(h’assus ad Euphraten aquilas natumque
Pei-gi'cffifflt leto est ultimus ipse datus.
Partho, qnid exultas? dixit dea: signa

Propertius in the following places refers
prospectively to the recovery of these stan-
dards, showing how much importance the
Romans attached to it (ii. 10. 133 iii. 4. 93
5. 483 iv. 6. 79). On this subject see
C. iii. 5. 3, and Introduction.
