Me possum casu quod te sortitus amicum;
Nulla etenim mihi te fors obtulit: optimus olim

Virgilius, post hunc Varius dixere quid essem.

Ut veni coram singultim pauca locutus,

Infans namque pudor prohibebat plura profari,
Non ego me claro natum patre, non ego circum
Me Satureiano vectari rura caballo,

Sed quod eram narro.

Pauca: abeo; et revocas nono post mense jubesque

Esse in amicorum numero.

Quod placui tibi qui turpi secernis honestum,
Non patre praeclaro sed vita et pectore puro,

Atqui si vitiis mediocribus ac mea paucis

Mendosa est natura alioqui recta, velut si
Egregio inspersos reprehendas corpore naevos;
Si neque avaritiam neque sordes aut mala lustra

⁴ possim, 'and one of the Scholiasta (Comm.

Cruq.) seems to have read‘ possuntss which
Bentley adopts, once more on the acore of
arrogance,⁴ ‘arrogantiae quid prae se ferre
videtur illud nort Possm«. Itane vero?
Non cognosco tuum, O F'lacce, tam su-

perbum: ut enim hoc vere dici posset tu
tamen non idoneus qui id diceres; neque
vero si bene te novimus dicere unquam
voluistil' Most persons will think that this
apostrophe is thrown away, and that there
is no arrogance in the first person which' is
not involved as much' ιιι the third. An the
MSS. have the first either· m the indicative
or the subjunctive mood. 1 prefer the
former3 Orelli does not. His detractore
were fond of calling Horace ‘⁴ Fortunae
filius” (S. ii. 6. 49). Bentley is equally
eloquent on the reading ⁴ mihi te fors ob-
tulit: which he declares is“ quam inscite
et stolide hic dictum ut nihil magis. Quid
enim? an patrono et rege suo Maecenate,
cui vitam, opes, omnia debuit. majorem
hic se gerit coactor-is Graeculi filius. ² Tibi
vero, o Noster, Maecenatem fors obtulerit?
quod sodes ex te verbum audio? Immo te
Maecenati nisi omnium quotcunque fuerunt,
sunt. eruntve Suffenorum rimus es.”
‘Tibi me' he found in one S„ and so
Cruquius’ Scholiast seems to have read the
passage. But there is perhaps more mo-
desty and feeling in the poet’s saying that
his fortune or hia friends presented him
with a kind and power-ful patron, than that
he wasthrowninthewayofthegreat man.

The Mss„ with the above exception, have
all ⁸ mihi μὴ’ and the common sense of all
the editors 1 have seen but Cunningham
and Sanadon has disregarded Bentley’s
tirade.

55. Viryilius, poet laune Varius] See
S. ὅ. 40, n.

59. Satureiano] A fine horse bred in
the pastures of Saturium in Calabria, near
Tarentum, according to Servius ou Georg. ii.
197. The Scholiast Porphyrion says it was
a place iu Apulia. The lengthening of the
antepenult is required by the metre. Others
explain Saturi Tarenti in the above pmage
of Virgil from Saturus being a divinity par-
ticularly worshipped by the Tarentinea.
(Cic. in Verr. ii. 460.) This would make
⁶ Sat. caballo ' merely a Tarentino horse.

64. sed vita et pectore pura] ¹ Not as
being the son of a distinguished father, but
because my life and beart were pure.’ So 1
understand the words. Orelli says this in-
terpretation is ⁸⁶ prorsus imperita,” and
applies ‘ vita et pectore puro' to the father,

‘as born of a father not distinguished, but
of life and heart pure! 1 do not think
Maecenas considered what was the charac-
ter of Horace’s father, but what was his
own.

68. aut mala lustra] The received
reading till Bentley was ‘ ac.’ No MS. has
⁶ aut‚' and Bentley and subsequent editors
have supposed no edition had that word3
but it appears in Ascensius’ edition of 1519.
Where he got it does not appear, for the
