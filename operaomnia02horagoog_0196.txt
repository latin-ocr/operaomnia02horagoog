Amphion's, were those of Orpheus, and of the lyre in his handqnot Mercury'a, which

ARGUMENT.

Morem, who didst teach Amphion to move stanes, and thou, lyre, once dumb now wel-
oome at feast and festival, tune me a eti-ain vo which even Lyde, though she be free
ae the young colt, must attend. Thou chax-meet figere, woods, sti-eamn, and hell’a bloody

· sentiuel, and Ixion, and Tityus, and the daughters of Danae. Let Lyde hear of their
crime and punishment, and how one was merciful and spa-ed her young husband's
life, saying‚ ‘⁴ Rine up ς begone, lest the uleep of death overtake thee. They have sprung
upon their prey. My heart is not aa their beart. 1 windo thee no barm. laet my
father do with me as he vin, yet go thou while night and love protect thee. Fal-ewen,
and when 1 am gone engi-ave a word of sorrow on my tomb.”
