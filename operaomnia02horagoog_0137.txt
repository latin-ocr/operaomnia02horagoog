MaecenaS, melius ductaque per vias
Regum colla minacium.

Me dulces dominae Musa Licymniae

Cantus, me voluit dicere lucidum

Fulgentes oculos et bene mutuis

Fidum pectus amoribus ;
Quam nec ferre pedem dedecuit choriS,

· Nec certare joco nec dare brachia
Ludentem nitidis virginibus sacro

Dianae celebris die.

Maecenas was an author, though probably
an indifferent one; and Horace may have
put off his request that 110 should write a
oetical account of Augustus' achievements
iiy suggesting that 110 should write one in
prose. It does not follow that Maecenas
ever wrote or that Horace ever seriously
intended to advise his writing. ⁴ Pede-
stribus’ is an adaptation of the Greek
πεζὸς λόγος for ⁸ prose,’ or ⁴ soluta oratio‚’
which latter was the usual expression for
prose in Horace's time. He uses the word
⁴ pedester’ again twice to express a plain
style of speech, hut not for proseas opposed
to poetry (S. ii. 6. l7): ‘⁴ Quid prius illus·
uem satiris musaque pedestri ?'' and (A.
P. 95) “tragicus ·plerumque dolet ser-

mone pedestri.” Quintilian uses the word

but expressly as a Graecism (see Forcell.).
The word ⁴ prosa,’ or ⁸ prorsa,’ as its correct
form appears to be, is of later use than the
age of Augustus.

11. ductaque per vias] See C. i. 2. 493
iv. 2. 35, n. Epod. vii. 7.

12. minacium] The MSS. vary between
‘ minacium ’ and ⁴ minantium,’ which words
might easily be confounded through the
omission of the mark usually substituted
for ⁸ n’ in the latter, ⁴ minatium! But
the participle would signify that they were
now threatening, which would perhaps be
out of character, though Jani thinks ‘mi-
nanuum’ very graphio: ⁸⁴ Quam graphicum
hoc!” Jani ‘is abundant in exclamation.
Bentley quotes Ovid (Trist. iv. 2. 21, sqq.) t

‘⁶ Vinclaque captiva reges cervice gerentes
Ante coronatos ire videbit equos.
Et cernet vultus aliis pro tempore versos
Terribiles aliis, immemoresque sui.''

⁴ Minax ’ is a favourite word with Horace.
13. dominae] If by Licymnia is meant

Terentia (see Introduction), ‘ dominae ' may

stand for wife, as in Virg. (Aen. vi. 397)2

‘⁸ Hi Ditis dominam thalamo deducere
adorti.’' Ovid (Trist. iii. 3. 23)= “ Nun-
tiethucaliquis dominam venisse, resurgam ;”
and again in the forty-first verse :—

⁶⁸ Nec dominae lacrymis in nostra caden-
Acoetdziii ¹iiiiirnae tempora parva meae?”

So‘ amans :’ ‘⁶ vanaspe lusit amantem ’⁹ (Aen.
i. 352). Some MSS. have ‘dulcis3' and
the editors differ as to the substantive to
which this epithet belongs, ⁸ musa,' ‘ domi-
nae,’ or ‘cantus.' Bentley edits ‘ dulcis:
hut quotes the line with ‘ dulces,' which he
preferred therefore is plain ς and it is likely
that the transcribers who wrote ⁶ dulcis'
meant it for ⁶ dulceis,' the accusative me.
‘ Cantus' wauts an epithet.

14. tucidum Fuqentes] Dillenbr. has a
note here in which he says the neuter ad-
jective is used adverbially in phrases like
this, where there is to be expressed of the
subject not only what it is but what it does.
In this place he says “ oculi tantopere ful-
gent ut lucere videantur.” 1 do not quite
see the distinction. Had he said ‘⁴ tantopere
fulgent ut lucere videantur,” it might be
supposed he meant that the eyes shone so,
they seemed to cast forth lightning, ⁸ ful-
gere’ being equivalent to ⁴ fulgorem emit-
tere! In ⁶ turbidum laetatur' (ii. 19. 6) the
remark is more clearly verified, since there
he who rejoices is also confused. In
¹ dulce ridentem’ (i. 22. 23); ⁶ perfidum
rideus’ (iii. 27. 67); she who smiles is also
sweet or roguish, and so on in ‘ gratum
elocuta' (iii. 3. l7); ‘ resonarent triste’
(S. i. 8. 41), &c., but 1 do not see what is
gained by the observation. The neuter
adjective only pei-forms in these cases the
office of an adverb, which is very common
in all languages.

20. Dianae celebris dia] Her festival
was held on the ides of August. The dances
