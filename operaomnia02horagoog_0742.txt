Ut nihil intersit Davusne loquatur et audax
Pythias emuncto lucrata Simone talentum,
An custos famulusque dei Silenus alumni.

Ex noto fictum carmen sequar,

ut sibi quivis 240

Speret idem, sudet multum frustraque laboret
Ausus idem: tantum series juncturaque pollet,
Tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris.
Silvis deducti caveant me judice Fauni,

N e velut innati triviis ae paene forenses

245

Aut nimium teneris juvenentur versibus unquam,
Aut immunda crepent ignominiosaque dicta;
Offenduntur enim quibus est equus et pater et res,
Nec, si quid fricti ciceris probat et nucis emptor,

Aequis accipiunt animis donantve corona.

Syllaba longa brevi subjecta vocatur iambus,

238. Pythias emuncto] Comm. Cruq.
says this is the name of a slave girl who got
money out of her master Simo as a portion
for his daughter, in a play of Ludlius, for
which Orelli thinks we should read Caeci·
lius. As to ⁴ emuncto' see S. i. 4. 8, n.

239. Silenus] This god is said to have
educued Bacchus. He represented the
⁴ crassa Minerva’ of the ancientn, ⁴ wisdom
under a rough exterior,' and it is in his
graver character that Horace here views
him. An ancient representations of Silenus
exhibit him aa a gross impersonation of
sensuality and low fun, usually drunk and
riding upon an ass, with Fauns daucing
about him. Modern ideas have confounded
him with Bacchus his foster-child.

240. Ex noto fictum carmen requam]
⁴ Ex noto ' (if I understand it right, but 1
am not sure) means ⁴ in ordinary language,'
such as any man thinks he could write, but
not every man when he comes to try suc·
ceeds, for it is the connexion (see v. 48)
and ordering of the words and incidente and
illustratione that gives so much charm to
common lang-uage. ‘ Ex noto ’ might mean
that the subject must be familiar. The
context to be sure is about words3 but there
is no depending on the context in this poem,
the parts are so loosely put together (see
Introduction).

244. Fauna] 800 c. ii. 19. 4,n. Horace
says that these rough beings introduced from
the woods should not talk as is they hed been
bomin the city and vvere loungers in the Fo-
rum, or languish in love verses like a mawkish
youth3 but neither should lovv language be

put into their mouth, for this is sure to

offend the reflned part of the audience, even
if the vulgar applaud it. ‘ Juvenor ' is a
word not found elsewhere: it is adopted
stom the Greek νεανιεύεσθαι. ‘Forenses ’
is used aa Livynses it (ix. 46): “Ex eo
tempore (the censorship of Appius Claudius)
in duas partes discessit civitas. Aliud in-
teger populus fautor et cultor bonorum,
aliud forensis factio tenebat, donec Q. Fabius
et P. Decius censores facti: et Fabius simul
concordiae causa, simul ne humillimorum
in manu comitia essent, omnem forensem
turbam exa-etam in quattuor tribus con-
jecit, urbanasque eas appellavit.’'

248. et pater] ⁴ Those who had a father ’
means ⁴ ingenui, those who vvere born free
and of lawful wedlocit, since none others
vvere ‘inpatria potestate! As to ‘cicer’
see S. i. 6.115, n.

251. Syllaba lonya brevi] As to the
‘iambus’ see above, v. 79, sq. Horace
here calls it ‘pes citus,' a rapid foot, as
elsewhere (C. i. 16. 24) he speaks of ³ celeres
iambos-⁹ He says the rapidity of the foot
caused the division of the verse into the
from of a trimeter, whereas it was a ⁸ sena·
rius: having six distinct iambic feet. The
admission of a spondeo in the odd feet,
he says, was an aster invention, in order to
give more weight to the measure. What
he means by ‘ non ita pridem ' is not very
clear. 1 suppose he means comparatively
lately3 but the verses of Archilochus had
spondees in them. The history is not
very accurate. Horace hm himself imi-
tated the pure iambic measure in the alter-
nate verses of Epod. 16. ⁸ In jura paterna
recepit ' 1 suppose is to be rendered ‘ gave
