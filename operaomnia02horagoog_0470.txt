SA TIRARUM II. 1.

445

Cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque

Invidia, et fragili quaerens illidere dentem

Offendet solido; nisi quid tu, docte Trebati,
DissentiS.'' “ Equidem nihil hinc diffindere possum.

Sed tamen ut monitus caveas, ne forte negoti

80

Incutiat tibi quid sanctarum inscitia legum:
Si mala condiderit in quem quis carmina, jus est

J udiciumque.”

‘⁶ Esto, si quis mala; sed bona si quis

J udice condiderit laudatus Caesare? si quis

Opprobriis dignum latraverit, integer ipse 3''

78. nisi quid tm] This is equivalent to
saying, ‘this is what 1 think, Tr·ebatius;
but I shall be glad to defer to your opinion
if you differ from me.'

79. nihil hinc diffindere possum] This
was the reading of Comm. Cruq.; for he
explains it thus: ⁸⁸ lusu-mare, mutare, dif-
ferre, utitur Trebatius juris antiqui verbe.
Praetor enim solebat dicere ⁸ hic dies dif-
fissus esto) ” Porphyrion's note in Ascen-
sius' text is ‘⁸ diffinger03 legitur etiam diffi-
dere,” which Ι take to mean ‘diffindere,'
the usual mark over the ⁸ ῖ ' being omitted.
There are more readings in the MSS. and
editions here thau in almost any other verse
of Horace. They vary in the first place
between ⁸ hinc ’ and ⁸ hic,’ and for the verb
they have ‘diffundere,' ⁸ diffidere‚' ⁸defin-
gere‚' ⁸ defindere,' ⁸ diffindere,' ‘diffingere,'
⁸ diffigere,’ ⁸ defringere! Fea says the ba-
lance of MSS. and editions is in favour of
⁸ diffingere‚' though he prefers ⁸ diffindere!
Bentley argues for ⁸ diffingere ' in the sense
in which it is used in C. iii. 29. 47: ‘⁴ Dif-
finget infectumque reddet ;” and Heindorf
agrees with him. The oldest editions have
that word, and Lambinus was the first to in-
troduce ⁸ diffindere! It will be seen that the
Scholiast says ⁸ diffindere ' is a legal τοι-ως
but as such it is only used in the sense of
adjourning business to another day, and was
peculiar to the praetor-’s functions; that
sense too has no place here. (See Porcell.).
Fea‚ however, with whom Orelli agrees,
thinks Horace jocularly puts a legal term in
Trebatius' mouth, because he was a lawyer,
but without meaning it should have more
than its primax-y signification, which would
be ⁸ to cut off,’ and so Trebatius means
there is no part of what Horace has said
that he wished to cancel or separate from
the rest, as the bad is separated from the
giiii.. ἷηῗῗῖῗ. ’ἒὲἶῖῈὲ ⁰123&AEss
sense here; and as to the supposed joke, it
does not atrike me very forcibly. Doering

85

reads ⁸ diffindere,’ but supposes it to have
the meaning of ⁸ secare' above (S. i. 10. 15,
and Epp. i. 16. 42); that is, to decide3
and Trebatius, therefore, according to him,
says he cannot decide the question from
the premises Horace has put before him
(⁸ hinc ’). Cicero has ⁸ dissolvere' in a
sense something like this (de Orat. ii. §2:36)2
⁸⁸ Orator odiosas res saepe quas argumento
dilui non facile est joco risuque dissolvit.”
1 think Doering's suggestion is worthy of
consideration.

80. Sed tamen] If Doering’s interpreta-
tion of ⁸ diffindere ' be correct, Trebatius
means ⁸ though Ι cannot pretend to decide
the case you put before me, I think it right
to warn you,' διο. If the other be Horace's
meaning, 'rrebatius says ⁸ though I have no
fault to find with your remarks, still? διο.
By the XII Tables, the writing of scurrilous
verses was among the few offences that
were punishable with death. See Dict. Ant.,
art. ⁸ Injuria,’ and compare Epp. ii. 1. 153.
There was a ‘lex Cornelia de injuriis,'
which probably included the offence of
writing scurrilous verses. But Augustus
himself aster this Satire was written) ap·
pears to ave proposed a law on the subject,
as we learn from Suetonius (Octav. c. 55)=
⁸⁸ Id modo censuit cognoscendum de iis qui
libellos aut carmina ad infamiam cujuspiam
suo vel alieno nomine edant.” When Tre-
batius says there is ⁸ J'us judiciumque,’ he
means that there is law and also there are
legal proceedings for this case. ⁸ Ne forte ’
is used as in C. iv. 9. l, where see note, and
compare Epp. i. 1. 13, 18. 583 ii. 1. 208.
With Heindorf 1 understand ⁸ sanctarum ’
to be a participle, ⁸ quae sanciuntur! ⁸ San-
cire legem' was to affix the penalty to a
⁸ lex,’ and so give it effect.

85. latraverit,] There is a
what Bentley says in favour of ⁸ laceraverit,'
which word he adopts. Lambinus had
some MS. authority for it, aud Heindorf
adopts it. But ⁸ latraverit ’ appears in nearly

deal in
