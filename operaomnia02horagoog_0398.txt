Viverem uti contentus eo quod mi ipse parasset:
“Nonne vides Albi ut male vivat filius, utque

Barrus inops? Magnum documentum ne patriam rem
A turpi meretricis amore

Perdere quis velit.”

Ne sequerer moechas concessa cum venere uti

Membra animumque tuum nabis sine cortice.'' Sic me

108. quod mi ipse par-weh] Horace's
father 1111ιί lived a life of {rugel industry, und
in addition to any ‘peculium’ he may have
laid by as u ‘leet-vus he made enough
money by his occupatiori of‘ coactor' (S. 6.
80) to purcbnse ιι farm of no great velue
st Venusia, to puy for his scn’ s educetion
st Rome, und enable him to continue it st
Athens.

100. Albi ut male vivatfllim] See above,
v. 28, ιι. The MSS. snd editions very be-
tween the forms Barrus, Bsrtus, Batus,
Varus, Rarus, Baius, os which the lust is
said to be most common. Estrs follows
Bentley in reading Burus. Tbis person, st

edin Barus, 110 proposes the emendation

peter suis monitis monere solitus esset in-
teres multos percutit? Scstanius (other-
wise Sectsuius) is not more known than
Burrus. Tnebonius was the ιιοιιιο of a
plebeisn gens of some distinction, but which
of them Horace ussudes to it is impossible
to suy- Even the Scholiasts ure silent. He
appears to heve been the hero of some
notorious bit of scsudnl, and to have pcid a
severe penalty for his vice.

115. Sapiens vitatu quidque petitu]
Horucs'sfstherhndno mindtorefineupon

the foundation of moi-uls, nor sny preten-
sion to ιι philosophica view of these matters.
He knew that right wss right sud wrong
was wrong, and followed the benten unck,
sud would heve his son do the same.
Horace expresses tbe sume below, S. 6 :—

44 — Quid mults? pudicum,
οι11 primus virtutis honos, servavit ab omni
Non solum facto verum opprobrio quoque

tun-pist

The whole of the passage there should be
compared with this. The elder Hcrsce was
no doubt ο plain sensible man.

121. For-mahat] This is Horacc' s usual
word sor education. C. i. lo. 2· 4οιιί seros
cultus homiuum recentum Voce ἴοι-1111111111.η
See C. iii. 24. 64, n.

123. Unum ex judicibus selectis] It was
tho duty cs the Prtetor Urbnnus annuully
to select a certain number of persons whose
names were registsred iu the Album Judi-
cum Selectorumr und· from whom were
chonen by lot the ‘'judices scr each 1111111.
Itis uncertain whether st this time, οι· by s
subsequent‘ lex‘ of Augustus, their flanc-
tions were extended to civilus well ss ιιι-11111-
nnl proceedings. The number of these
‘judices' varied. By the‘ lex Servilia Glcuds
Repetundnruur' it was fixed st 450. The
law that was in force st the time Horace
refers to τηε the· lex Amm’ by which
the Judioes selecti were medo yeligible
