EPoDoN LIBER, 5. 287

Non defuisse masculae libidinis
Ariminensem Foliam
Et otiosa credidit Neapolis
Et omne vicinum oppidum,
Quae sidera excantata voce Thessala 46
Lunamque caelo deripit.
Hic irresectum saeva dente livido
Canidia rodens pollicem
Quid dixit aut quid tacuit? Ο rebus meis
Non infideles arbitrae, 60
Nox et Diana quae silentium regis
Arcana cum fiunt sacra,
Nunc, nunc adeste, nunc in hostiles domos
Iram atque numen vertite 1
Formidolosis dum latent silvis ferae 55
Dulci sopore languidae, ·
Senem, quod omnes rideant, adulterum
Latrent Suburanae canes
Nardo perunctum, quale non perfectius
Meae laborarint manus.- 60
