Insanire paret certa ratione modoque.

Quid, cum Picenis excerpens semina pomis
Gaudes si cameram percusti forte, penes te es?
Quid, cum balba feris annoso verba palate,

Aedificante casas qui sanior!

Stultitiae atque ignem gladio scrutare.

quotes this in conjunction with
others, in which ‘explico' signifies to gain
a point or serve a purpose. He explains
‘explicet’ by‘ effim'atss ‘fassequatur ’.οδ

27 2. Picenis excerpens semina pomis]
The orchards of Picenum, the district that
lay between the country of the Sabines and
the Redi-istic, appear to have been cele-
brated. In the next Satire (ver. 70) Pice-
nian apples are said to be superior ιο those
of Tibur, and they are mentioned many
years later by Juvenal (xi. 74) :—

⁴⁴ —- de corbibus isdem
Aemula Picenis et odoris mala recentis-'¹

The pears of this same conum-y are com-
mended by Pliny (N. H. xv. 15. 16). Mar-
tial mentions the olives and the breed of
Picenum as perticulsrlygood (xiii. 36 and
47). The Scholiasta Porphyrion and Comm.
Cruq. explain the sport here alluded ιο.
laven, ssy they, were wont to take the pip s
of apples between their finger and thumb
and shoot them up to the ecilin& and ir
they struck it then their wish would be ac-
comp lished. Pollux relatus the seme sports
(ix-128), and some such are common in
our own narses-ies. ‘scameras which is
from the Greek καμάρα, and is sometimes
spelt with an ⁴a.¹ was an arched ceiling, as
‘lacunar’ was flat. The latter was so
called from panels with raised sides, and so
having each the appearance of a ⁴ lacus ¹ or
shallow reservoir, into which the ceiling was
sometimes divided. It was common in rich
houses for the ceiling to bo richly orna-
mented. See C. ii. 18. 2ε “Νοιι ebur
3325 Ἢ (τᾷεςῗξῑξ, ¹¹² ἕξω
quse nunc et ιιι privatis domibus auro te·

guntur, post Carthaginem eversam primo
insuram. sunt in Capitolio! ‘laquear is
mother form οῖ’ lacunar-¹ Horace also
uses the expression· laqueata tecta¹ (C. ii.
16. 12), which is found in other writers.
Ovid alone uses the word⁴ lacunoss to form
such ceilings (Met. viii. 663).

273. penes te esf] This seems to cor-
mpondp to the Greek be ἑαυτῷ εἶναι, for a
man in his right mind. or it may mean
to ask if the man is‘ suo jure, ’which one
who was ⁴ furiosus ¹ would not be.

27⁴. cum balbaseris] Persius has imi-
tated this in a different connexion (i. 33) 2—-

“ Rancidulum quiddam balba de nsre lo-
Phylffdzs Hypsipyles, vatum et plorabile ¹
ΕΗςιιΞΞᾚ tenero supplantat verba pa

Persius says ‘he trips his words on his
minciug palate 3¹ Horace says ⁴ you striks
your lisping words against your old palate.¹

275. Adde morem Stalticius] But
childish nonsense is not the worst of this
madness. Add bloodshed to folly and run
into the most violent excesses of passion,
and you will not do more thau such lusts
commonly lead to. Such is the Stoic¹s
meaning. ‘Ignem gladio scrutare¹ is a
translation of s Greek saying. πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ
σκαλεύειν, ‘to stir the fire with the sword,¹
which Diogenes Lsert. (viii. 17) pttributes
to Pythagoras. Heindorf says it is capsble
of various interpretations. Its application
here seems plain. Το stir the fire of lust
with the sword, is to stir up strife and blood-
shed in the indulgence of your lusts.

276. Modo, inquam, Hellade peremta]
‘To take s late instance,¹ seems to be the
meaning of ⁴ modo-¹ The story here re-
ferred to, as Estre says, was probably well ,
