CARMINUM 111. 12. 173

Quae velut nactae vitulos leaenae
Singulos eheu lacerant: ego illis
Mollior neo te feriam neque intra

Me pater saevis oneret catenis 45
Quod viro clemens misero peperci ς
Me vel extremos Numidarum in agros
Classe releget.
Ι pedes quo te rapiunt et aurae
Dum favet nox et Venus, i secundo 50
Omine et nostri memorem sepulcro

CARMEN XII.

This ode represents s girl lamenting to herself over s love she must not indulge. The
majority of editions have supposed that the poet is himself addressing Neobule, and Iam-
binns mys, ‘⁶ haee ode est παραινετιεή sen προτρεπτικὴ, id eut sd suadendum et exhor-
tnndnm‚” the monning of which is not very dest. The wsy 1 understand the first
sinna snd its connexion with the second moy be seen from the Argument. Some sup-
pose that Neobule is oonmting her own condition with that of others. ⁸ Misersble tre
the women who cannot indulge in love and wine ; for thee, Neobule‚ it is otherwise! 1 do
not qnsrrel with that interpretation, but prefer the other. There is a fragment of Alaeus
(58 Bergk) that may have belonged ω s poem which furnished the materiale of this ode.
Some have assumed it to be s free mnslstion from Alcaeus' poem. There is nothing
moreto jndge from than this fragment, which runs thus: ἐμὲ δειλόν, lp} παισᾶν κακοφά-
των πεδέχοισαν, which line, ss fer ss it goes, is in ferom- of the interpretation 1 have
given.

ARGUMENT.

Poor women! we must not love, we must not drown esre in wine, or s oeuel guardian
soolds ns to death. Alnsl Neobule, thou must not spin nor work for love of Hebrus,
so beautiful es he bathen in the wsters of Tiber, a horsemsn like Bellerophon, nnsnr-
psssed in the oombst end the rece, in piercing the flying deer or ostching the ltu-king
