Reges et regum vita praecurrere amicos.
Cervus equum pugna melior communibus herbis

dia animum infecimus: opinionibus maloque
more delinitum mollivimus.'’ This explains
the ‘ mala fastidia,’ which nature, silently
recovering her ground, contrives to sup-
p 26. Non qui Sidonio] On the position
of ⁸n0n,' see 8. i. 6. 1. This which Ob-
barius calls ⁴ difficillimus locus’ can have
'but one meaning. ⁶ Not he who knows not
skilfully to compare with Sidonian purple
the wool that drinks the dye of Aquinum,
shall suffer hai-m more certain or more
deep, than he who cannot tell truth from
falsehood.’ There is strong irony iu these
words, and they follow naturally on what
goes before, as representing the paltry ob-
jects with which the mind is employed in
what is called fashionable life to the de-
struction of the moral sense. For examples
of this use of ‘ contendere,' see Forcell.
The MSS. vary between ⁴ propiusve ' and
⁶ propiusque! There is not much to choose
between them, but 1 prefer ⁴ que!

The ⁴ murex ' and ‘ purpura,' which were
the shall-fish from which the purple ‹lye
was obtained, abounded on the coasts of
Italy. These of Baiae were most cele-
brated on the west coast (S. ii. 4. 32, n.),
and those of Tarentum on the east (Epp. ii.
l. 207). The foreign purples (enumerated
on C. ii. 16. 36) were most esteemed, and
these were imitated by the Italians. The
inicos varied in colour in various places ac-
cording to climate *and local circumstances.
That part of the fish which yielded the dye
was extracted (see S. ii. 4. 32, n.) and
strewed with salt in the proportion of 20
ounces to 100 pounds of fish. This caused
the juice to flow, aud kept it from putrefac-
tion. After remaining thus for three days
the juice was drawn off into a leaden caul-
dron, the heating of which gave the colours
additional brilliancy. After ten days of this
process, by which the fleshy particles were
carried off, the liquor was fit for use. The
wool was ateeped for five honre, aud then

dried and carded ς and this was repeated till
the dye was sufficiently imbibed according
to the quality required. 'rho ‘ fucus ' was a
marine plant of some kind which yielded a
red juice used for colonring. Pliny (xxvi.
1⁰) says that wool was sometimes stained
with this before it was steeped in the pur-
ple. But it was commonly used in imitation
of the real dye. Hence it came to be used
for deception in general (see Porcellini).
Aquinum (Aquino), the birth-place of
Juvenal, was a large town of Latium on
the Via Latina, between and
Venafrum. We hear no where else of its
‹mrying on a trade in dyed articles3 and
Comm. eruq„ who says that it did so, seems
only to have got his information from this
passage. The town of Amyclae, on the
Latin coast, seems to have dealt in the
same imitation wools which ovid mentions
(Rem. Am. 707) :—

“Confer Amyclaeis medicatum vellus ahenis
Murice cum Tyrio, turpius illud erit,”

which Quintilian quotes (xii. 10. 75), say-
ing, “Ut lana tincta fuco citra purpuras
placet, at si contuleris Tyriae lacernae con·
spectu melioris obruam-fl
