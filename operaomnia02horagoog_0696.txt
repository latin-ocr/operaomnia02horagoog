154. Describh] This is used in the
same sense in S. i. 4. 3: “Si quis erat
dignus describi.” ⁴ Fustuarium ⁹ was amede
of putting ιο death by beating with sficks
aud stoning, usually but not only, as the
passage shows, inflicted on soldiers. (See
Dict. Aut.

and Livy makes cato say, speaking in favour
of the Lex Oppia (xxxiv. 4): ‘⁸ Haec ego, quo

ridentes? Compare also what Livy says
(xxv. ⁴0) respecting the spoils imper-ted by
Marcellus from Syracuse, which city was
taken Α.υ.ο. 542, the seventh year of the
second Punic war, after which Horace dates
the study of Grecian literature at Rome.
In Α.υ.ο. 608, the last year of the third
Punic war, Corinth was taken by Mummius,
and Seuthem Greece was formed into the
Roman province of Achaia. Horace had
probably both these periods in his mind, as
well as the conquest of Seuthem Italy, in
the towns of which were some of the {inest
works of Grecian art. Gellius (xvii. 21)
quotes two trochaic verses of Porcius Lici-
nius, a poet whose age is unknown ε

⁶⁶ Poegffl beno mundo Musa pinnato
U

Polymetis (pp. 36, sqq. fol. edit.) for an
account of the progrees of the Romans in
the appreciation of Greek literature and
arta. A reference to the note on v. 62 will
show that the first play copied from the
Greek was not exhibited at Rome till after
the first Punic war, which ended iu a.u.c.

158. Defluxit ’ωηεν-ω Saturnino] The
Saturnian verse, according ιο Niebuhr (i.
259, n.), continued in use down ιο the
middle cf the seventh century of the city.
It consisted of a great variety of lyrical
matres, which he says were carried to a
high degree of per-fection (but see his speci-
mens below). According ιο this it survived
Lucilius, and was not extinct when (ἧσαι-ο
was born. Horace says traces of the old
rudeness remained in his day, probably in
the less polished ¹ mimes,' and in the ‘Fes-
cennina carminass which were not extinct-
Niebuhr quotes the ‘⁶ lex horrendi carminis,”
given in Livy (i. 26) as a specimen of this
mensuret
‘⁴ Dufimviri perduellidnem judicent

si a duumviris provocavit,

Provocatidne certito:

Si vincent caput obnubito:

Infelici arbore reste suspendite:

verberato intra vel extra pomoerium?

1 have given the verses according ιο Nie-
buhr’s arrangement and accentuatiou, but
they appear ιο be quite arbitrary, and afl'ord
no traco of rhythm. It was with reference
ιο the Saturnian verses that Ennius said:
“ Scripsere' alii rem

Versibus quos olim Fauni vatesque cane-
Quuriinilssque Musarum scopulos quisquam

superarat,
Nec dicti studiosus erat.”

This verse, Niebuhr says (ii. 592, n.), was
always used iu inscriptions ; as that in which
Τ. Quinctius, the dictator, recorded his cap-
ture of nine towns, mmc- 375 (Livy vi. 29),
the earliest inscription on record. It has
been thus restored =
