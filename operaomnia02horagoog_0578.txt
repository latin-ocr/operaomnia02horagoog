EPISTOLARUM Ι. 1.

Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto.
Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque;
Sed quadringentis sex septem milia desunt,

Plebs eris.
‘⁴ Si recte facies.''

At pueri ludentes, “ Rex eris,” aiunt,
Hic murus aeneus esto,

Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.
Roscia, dic sodes, melior lex an puerorum est
N enia, quae regnum recte facientibus offert,

' Et maribus Curiis et decantata Camillis?

Isne tibi melius suadet qui rem faciae, rem,

Si possis recte, si non quocunque modo rem,

property, whatever your genius, character,
eloquence, end uprightness may be, you
are put down for one of the common sort,
and will not be allowed, under Otho’s law,
to sit in the frent rows! (See Epod. iv.
15, n.) Juvenal (v. 132) puts the opposite
cnse, and says:

‘⁴ Quadringenta fibi si quis Deus aut similis
Autliiilior fatis donaret homuntio, quantus
Ex nihilo fies.”

‘Plebs ' is not used in its regular senoe,
but contemptuously, ⁴ a common follow!
The equestrian order consisted of all citizens
who hed the above income and were not
senator-1⁵3 for when a man became s senator
he ceased ω be sn ⁶ eques.'

On which there is a long Scholisst's note:
τῶν οὖν παιζόντων ταῦτα (i. e. τὴν σφαῖ-
ραν) τοὺς μὲν νικῶντας βασιλεῖς ἐκάλουν,
καὶ ὅτι ἂν προσέτασσον τοῖς ἄλλοις ὑπ-
ήκουον, τοὺς δ’ ἡττωμένους ὄνους. Tbey
who threw or caught the bau best were
called king-⁸3 while they who were beaten
were called asses. Some such geme must
have been in use among the Roman boys,
and their king-maldng had become a pro·
verb. ΤΙιο world may despise you, he says,
because you ere poor, but, according to the
boys’ rule which makes the best man king,
you shall be a king if you do well. As to
⁴ murus aeneus’ see C. iii. 3. 65, n. For

signifies s sort of song of triumph. The
note just referred to may be corrected by
this explanation. Through s mistake of
mine or the printer’s, this ⁴ uenis ’ has been
mede to stand for'a night-song, ss in C. iii.

64. Et maribus C'ariis ct decantata

Horace’s selecting him for an illustration
here: ‘⁴ Curio sd focum sedenti magnum
auri pondus Samnites cum attulissent, re-
pudiati ab eo sunt3 non onim aurum habere
praeclarum sibi videri dixit, sed iis qui
heberent aurum im .’' The boys’
sti-sin was ever in the mouths of these
noble soldiers, giving honour to none but
the worthy. ‘Mares ’ is used in this sense
in A. P. 402: ⁴⁸ Tyrtaeusque mares animos
in Martia bella Versibus exacuit.”

person Comm. Cruq. writes ‘⁴ Puppius trs-

Wense

Flebunt amici et bene noti mortem meam,

We know nothing more of him than this.
‘Lscrimosa’ is used irordcslly. As to
‘responsare' see S. ii. 7. 85. ‘Praesens’
