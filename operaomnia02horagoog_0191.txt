Sospitis centum et vigiles lucernas
Perfer in lucem; procul omnis esto

Medus infestus sibi luctuosis

13. amici Sospite] Thia ia a Greek
construction, which occurs again in C. iii.
19. 9, 10. See Τ1ιοοο. xiv. 182

 

ἔδοξ’ ἐπικεῖσθαι ἄκρατον
ὧτειῖἕξῑ 1ἤθελ’ ἕκαστος· ἔδει μόνον ὕπνος

Horaoe'a request may amount to this, ‘ pray
that my life may be prolonged a hundred
years ς’ according to that of ovid (Fast. iii.

531, sqq.) :—

⁴⁴ Sole tamen vinoque oelent, annosque pre-

Quodlilffuinunt cyathos, ad numerumque
Inveiiid’ssugiio qui Nestoris ebibat annos,

Quae sit per calices facte Sibylla suoa.”

ροῃάοταξιωοοίῃῇυῐὲἳνιξέὴ is din mmihof
⁸ er. reia uri annomeoer
11ῖὲήὸ- have ⁶ profer! Foroellini, who gives
no signification of ⁴ perfero ' that would suit
this passage, quotes from Cicero (de Pin.
iii. 22. 76), “ beatam vitam usque ad illum
a Cyro exstructum rogum protulisset‚”
which is precisely the same ς but Orelli says
⁴ pertulisset ’ is the proper reading, and so
Ernesti has it, but says the other would do.
It is impossible to decide the question upon
its merite, and the MSS. are not ease guidea
in euch a matter. The abbreviations sor
‘per' and ‘pro' are nearly the same, as ob-
served by Mr- Long on cic. Divin. in Q.
Caecil- ο. 12. The objection taken to ⁴ pro-
fer' is that ‘in luoem proferre' means ‘to
bring to light! But in this phoa there
oould be no confusion. In C. iii. 21. 23 we
have ‘⁶ vivaeque producent lucernae,” where

‘vivae ’ eor-respondeto ‘ vigiles ' here. virgil

uses ‘serre’ unoompounded in Aen. ix.

little authority makes these adjectivae

22. caleam] Seenbove (Ο. ιι. 13. 18, n.).

23. Scythae] Franke supposes these ω
be the, Scythiam who had helped Phraaten.
Orelli aud Dillenbr. imagine them to be the
Geloni and other trmannubiau tribes. 1
believe Horace meant no more than gene-
rally to say that the enemim of Rome were
no longer disturbing her.

26. Parce privatur] This 1 lake to mean
no more than 1 have expressed in the Argu·
ment, not ‘⁴ cum sis privatua,” omni atys,
referring to Maecenas· refusal to ae-
natorial rank (C. i. 2⁰. ὃ, n.). Bentley
opposee ‘ privatus ' to ⁸ populus‚' and ex-
plains ⁶ sinoe you have no mune to be
anxious about public affaire do not be too
anxious about your own,’ and thia may be
the meaning. 1 am not certain of myown iu-
terpretation , but 1 feel sure Orelli’s is wrong.
In the next verae there is a 00th ιιι the
editions and MSS. between ⁴ cape ’ md
⁴ rape! Bentley defends the former became
it is not usual to anatoli a gissa, but only to
take it quietly. His arguments will not osten
bear being translated into English. Orelli’a
MSS. all have ‘cape :’ hut they sia-angely
omit the conjunctim at the end of the verae,
transferring it to the preceding line, where
it is not wanted 3 but there it appears in all
the MSS. except one of Bentley’a, and nu
the editions till lambinus’ second effitien-
