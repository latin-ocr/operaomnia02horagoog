make it the single business of their lives to
teu of chaste Minerva's city in nnbroken
song, and to gather a branch from every
olive to entwine their brow.’ A ‘ perpetuum
carmen ³ is a continuone poem such as an
Epic; and ‘a branch from every olive,' or
more literally ⁸ an olive-branch from every
qnarter,' can only mean that the various
themes connected with the glory of Athens
are as olive-trees, from each of which a
branch is plucked to bind the poet’s brow.
The figure is appropriate to the locality
(see Herod. v. 82. Soph. Oed. Col. 694,
sqq.). We do not know of any poem or
s to which‘ Horace may have alluded,
ut Athens furnished subjecte for the in·
ferior poets of the day. On the conjecture
of Erasmus, Lambinus and many of the
earlier editors, including Dacier, preferred
reading ⁸ undiquedecerptae frondi praeponere
olivam ⁹ ‘ to prefer the olive to boughs
gathered from all other trees! But as
Bentley shows, there is no necessity for
altering the reading of all the MSS. which
is that of the text. ⁸ Indeque ' (omitting ⁴ et ⁹)
would not be a bad emendation if emenda-
tion were wanted. It is adopted by Mitsch.
It is perhaps a little prosaic. ‘ Arces ' is the
reading of some MSS. for ‘urbem,' md
Bentley adopts it on the usual ground, that
it is the less likely word of the two to have
been coined, but the great majority of MSS.
and all the best have ‘ urbem.’

8. ⁴ Plurimus ' for ⁸ plurimi ⁹ standing
alone occurs no where else3 with a sub-
stantive it is not nncommon as ‘ Oleaster
plurimus,’ Georg. ii. 182. ‘ Plurimus aeger,’
Jnv. iii. 232. ⁴ In honorem,' for the ab·
latire, is an unusual construction. But
Propertius (iv. 6. 13) says, ‘⁴ Caesaris in
nomen ducuntur mnnina,” which is an
analogons case. See Hom. 11. iv. 51 ι

ἦ τοι ἐμοὶ τρεῖς μὲν πολὺ φίλταταί εἰσι
'Agma-mg Σπάρτη τε καὶ εὐρυάγυια
Μυκήνη.

⁸ Dite: Mycenas' is later: Μυκήνας τὰς
πολυχρύσους (Soph. Elect. 9). ‘ Opimae

hrissae' is llomeric3 Λάρισσα ἑριβώλαξ
(11. ii. 841). ‘ Patiens ’ is the Spartan's his-
torical character, but also that of Horace's
age, and he may have been at Lacedae-
mon and Larissa too in his campaigning.
Cicero (Tusc. τ’. 27) says, ‘⁴ Pueri Spar-
tiatae non ingemiscunt verberum dolore
laniati. Adolescentium greges Lacedaemone
vidimus ipsi, incredibili contentione cer-.
tantes pugnis, calcibus, unguibus, morsu
denique, ut exanimarentur prius quam se
victos faterentur.'' ‘ Percussit ' is generally
used with the ablative οἰ the instrument or
cause. standing alone in this way and in
the aoristic perfect it savonrs very much of
ἔπληξε, and the cde has traces of the
Greek in nearly every part.

12. Albuneae resonantia] One of the
Sibyla worshipped at 'Ebur gave her name
to a grove and sonutain. See Virg. (Aen.
vii. 81. sqq.):

‘⁴ At rex—oracula Fanni
Fatidici genitoris adit, lucosque snb alta
Consulit Albunea e nemorum quae maxima
Ἑοῑῗΐο sonat, saevamque exhalat opaca
mephitim.”

13. Tiburni lucus] Tiburnus (or —tus)
Catillus and Coras were the mythical
founders of Tibur. Aen. vii. 671 z

‘⁶ Fratris 'liburti dictam cognomine gentem
Cazilllsu’sflue acerque Coras, Argiva Juven-

The brothers had a ⁴ cultus' there and a
grove. 'liburnus was the tutelar deity of
Tibur, as Tiberinus was of the river fiber,
Auienus os the Anio, διο. Tbey are in
fact adJ‘ectives. 'Iibur was famous forits
orchard's. See Prop. iv. 7. 81 = ‘⁸ Pomosis
Anio qua spumifer incubat arvis;” and
Ovid, Am. iii. 6. 46 : ‘⁴ Tiburis Argei pomi-
fera arva rigas '' (if Bentley 's correction be
right, as it may be, reading ‘ pomifera'
for ⁸ spumifer ⁹).
