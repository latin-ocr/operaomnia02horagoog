It has been conjectured with probability that this ode was written soon ester the battle
of Actium, when Agripps's glory was st its height. It would seem that the general hsd
asked Horace ιο write sn ode in hissonoun but he had the good sense ιο decline s task
which he might not have executed sutisfsctffly ιο the great mnu or himself: st the sume
time he declined in the most greceful wey by inumafing that Agrippa deserved an Epic
rather than sn ode, und the pen of Verius rather than of Horace.

ARGUMENT.

dures not sing of these, of the wrsth of Achilles, or the wanderings of Ulysses, or the
fate of Pelops’ house, nor will she dispar-ege thy glories end Csoesr's. Who cun fitly
sing of Mars mail-clad, of Meriones blsck with the dust of Troy, of Diomed n match
for gods ἓ 1 sing but of fessts end of the batt-les of boys end girls.
