common.

33. Condito mitis placidusque telo] On
the promontory near Actium there was a
statue of Apollo with his bow bent and a
flerce aspect, which was an object of terror
to the sailors who approached the coast.
SeeVirg. (Aen. iii. 274, sq..) —

“Mox eg, lancatae nimbosa cacumina
mon

Et formidatus nautia aperitur Apolloss'

And again on the shield of Aeneas (viii. 704)
the same figure' is represented. —

“Actius haec cernens arcum intendebat
Deeffiffllo omnis eo terrore Aegyptus et
Οιιιξιὲἒίωᾼξώο, omnes vertebant terga

'l'o this god Augustus paid his devotione
before his battle with M. Antonius, and to
him he attributed his success. “ Vincit
Roma fide Phoebi ” (Propert. iv. 6. 57).
Accordingly, on his return to Rome, he
built a temple toApollo of Actium on Mons
Palatinus(v.65...pCi3.lE i..)317,

and set up a statue (executed by Scopas) ol·
that god, but in a different character, the
bow being laid aside and a lyre substituted

for it in one hand, and a plectrum in the
other. (“Citha.ra1i1jam poscit Apollo Vic-
tor, et ad placidos exuit arma choros,”
Prop. iv. 6. 69, sq.) Hem cladalsoin
along flowing robe. Propertius was present
at the dedication of the temple, and gives a
description of it (ii. 31), the last object he
mentions being the statue of Apollo as
above desa-ibed. —

“Deinde inter matrem deus ipse, interque
Pyt-hirtismiiil’longa carmina veste sonat.”

This change of character is what Horace
alludee to.

35. regrina bicornis] In a rilievo on
Constantine’s arch Diana, as the moon, is
represented in her chariot drawn by two
hones, and with a small mescent on her
forehead, which is a common way of -
senting her on geme and medals. In the
above group Hesperus is ssying in bont of
her.

41. fraude] C. ii. 19. 2⁰.

42. Castus] C. iii. 2. 30, where the corre·
lative term is used: “ Neglectus incesto
addidit integrum.” Aen.vi.661= “Quique
sacerdotes casti.’'

He says this arrangement is ‘melior, ro-
