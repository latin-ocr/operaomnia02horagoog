was a fine day, or that it looked as if it was
going to rain, but the formula in the text
,was equally commong see S. ii. 4. l, ‘⁸ Unde

Moeri, pedes? an, quovia ducit,in urbem ?’').
Fuscus goes on talking about nothing.
Horace winks at him, twitches him by the
toga, pulla him hythe arm: to allwhich
he gets no response3 the arm seems not to
feel, and its owner seems not to perceive,
while all the time he sees the fun and
laughs in his sleeve. Horace can bear it
no longer. ‘⁴ I think you had something
to say to me in private, had you not?”

⁴ vellere ¹ to the ⁴ toga! Bentley also reads
‘prensare,’ which appears in all the old
editions, and was first altered by Lambinus.

69. tricesima sabbaim] Very much has
been said on these words. Orelli gives a
calculation by Roeder, corrected by α’ dis-
tinguished divine, “eximius theologus,”
whose name he does not mention, which,
taking in the twenty-five Sabbatha from the
lst of Abib to Tisri, the seventh month,
adding thereto the σάββατον δευτερόπρυ-
rev—mentioned by St. Luke (vi. l), and
assumed ιο be the loth of Nisam which

Josephus says (Arch. iii. 1⁰. ὃς nii. 8. 4)

the Jews held as a sabbath—and the (lay of
Pentecost, which was also a sabbath, and
then adding the feast of Trumpets on the
lst Tisri, the oth Tisri which was the
regular sabbath, and the leth which was
the great day of atonement. makes this last
solemn day, on which whosoever did not
afflict himself should be cut off from among
the people (Levit. xxiii. 29), the ‘ tricesima
sabbata‚' or thirtieth sabbath from the
beginning of the Jewish sacred year.
Roeder himself, omitting St. Luke’s sab-
bath and Pentecost, and adding the regular
sabbath on the 12th Tisri and the Feast of
Tabernacles on the leth, makes that the
great day in question. The opinion of
Scaliger was, that the Jews observed the
30th day of each mouth as a sabbath.
Gesner and Doering, and some others,
follow Scaliger. Others suppose the day
of the Passover to be the sabbath in ques-
tion, and by calculatione try ιο prove that
it might have been. 1 do not find that it
is made out on any authority that the Jews
had any sabbath that they called the thir-
tieth, and I very much doubt the fact.
The utter contempt with which the Romans,
especially of Horace’s class, looked upon
the J ewish superstitious (as they counted
them), is the essence of the joke in the text.
That the Jews had a sabbath of course
every body knew. That they had a sabba-
tical year and a year of J ubilee no doubt was
known to some, and that this came round
every finey year-ag also that they obses-ved
days and months and years with scrupulous
exactness. Beyond this 1 should imagine
Aristius Fuscus knew little or nothing of
the Jews, except that they were a trouble-
some set of people, and lived by themselves
on the other side of the Tiben not sar by
the bye from where the party were stand·
ing. ‘Tricesima sabbata’ I believe to be a
mere extemporaneous invention made to
cover his retreat and tantalize his unfor-
tunate friend. Until some more definite
account is given ef the matter than any 1
have read, 1 shall venture ιο hold the above
