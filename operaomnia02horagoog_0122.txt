GARMINUM II. 6. 97

Beyond this we know nothing of Septimius, exeept that Cruquius' Scholiast makes him
the same as Titius in the epistle to Julius Florus (Epp. i. 3, v. 9, see note).

The date of this ode has been much discussed. Estre plaees it very soon aster Horaee’s
first arrival at Rome, when he was fresh from the fatigues of war, which the expresdon
⁴ Sit modus lasso maris et viarum Militiaeque' seems to favour. But a young man just
returning home to begin life does not begin by writing about a retreat for his declining
years. There is a character about the ode which belongs to a later period. He must
have been familiar with Tibur and Tarentum and other loealities which he alludes to. The
allusion to the Cantabri in v. 2 is supposed by others to fix the date much later, namely,
in Aac. 729, when Augustus was engaged in reducing a rebellion in Spain. At any time
before A.u.c. 725, when the Cantabri were first reduced, they could bave been called by
Horaee ‘ indoctos juga ferre nostra‚’ even though no attempt had been made to impose
that yoke. In 725 they were mduced to subjection3 in 728 they broke out again, and in
the following year they were finally subdued, though an unimportant disturbance had to
be put down by Agrippa some years afterwards (see C. iii. 8. 21 ς iv. 14. 41. Epp. i. 12.
26). If therefore the ode was written aster 725, it must have been in the beginning
of 729 or thereabouts, and 1 am inclined to think that was the date, though 1 admit the
difficulty of understanding why Horaee should speak os himself even poetically as tired of
warfare and the sea, so manyyears aster he had eeased to have anything to dowith
either. That he does not speak of his Sabine sarm, but gives the preference to Tibur
or Talentum, proves nothing. Long after he had possession of his farm, he expresses
his preference for those places (Epp. i. 7. 44) 2-

-- “ mihi jam non regia Roma
Sed vacuum Tibur placet aut imbelle Tarentum.”

(See also C. iii. 4. 21, sqq.) And that he frequented Tibur is well known. Some say
he owned, some he rented, a small property there. It may, however, be doubted aster
all perhaps, whether Horaee must be taken as speaking strictly of himself. He may only
mean in effect, that the weary need -seek no happier n sting-place than ‘Ebur or Tarentum,
though he puts the matter in the form of a wish for himself. It was probably on or after
a visit to Septimius that Horace eomposed the twenty-eighth ode of the first book3 and,
probably with the attractione of Tarentum fresh in his mind, he wrote this ode. But he

may have paid his friend many visits.
ARGUMENT.

Septimius, who art ready to go with me to the ends of the earth, 1 would that 1 might
end my days at Tibur, or, if that be forbidden me, at Tarentum. Above all others Ι ,
love that spot, with its honey, its olives, its long spring, and mild winter, and grapes
on Mount Aulon. On that spot we ought to live together3 and there thou shouldst

lay my bones and weep over them.
