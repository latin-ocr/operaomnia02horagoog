108 HORATII FLAGGI

CARMEN XI.

The date of this ode has been much discnssed. If any argument could be founded upon
the first line, it would naturally be inferred that the Cantabri and the Scythian tribes were
in arms at the time it was written. Lentulus' expedition against the tribes of the Danube,
who had invaded the Roman provinces is supposed, as 1 have said before (C. 9. 23, ιι.),
to have taken place while Augustus was in Spain. Supposing this to be alluded to, the
date of the ode may be considered settled within a year, that is, it must have been written
about A.u.c. 7293 and Horace speaks of his grey hairs (v. 15), which is consistent with
that date, for he was then forty. But the date of the expedition of Lentulus is uncertain.
The only authority on the subject is Florus (v. 12), who does not mention the date or
give any clue to it (see C. iii. 8. Introd.). But asterallit is not necessary to suppose that
Horace meant any thing very definite by thus coupling two distant and troublesome ene-
mies together. The name Scythian was applied to a great many people, some of whom
were continually giving trouble to the Romans; and as Ean-e says (p. 414) if Horace had
said,

‘⁶ Quid bellicosus Parthus et Aethiops,
or,
“ Quid bellicosus Medus et Allobrox
Hirpine Quinti cogitet Alpibus
Divisus objectis,”

the sense would have been just the uine, and the purpose of the writer as well answered.
that being merely to introduce a convivial ode. He has prefixed to it a name we hear of
no where else, and which has caused a good deal of difficulty to scholare. There is no
Hirpinus on record but this one, belonging to the Quintian family or any other.
Whether this person was a neighbour of Horace's, and got his name from his Sabine
connexion (the Hirpini were a Sabine people)‚ or whether Horace gave some friend this
name from some familiar whim unknown to us, is a matter of doubt. It hasbeen assumed
that this Quintius, and the one to whom is addressed Epp. i. 16, are the same. But the
latter appears to have been younger than the former, whom Horace addresses as if he
were a contemporary (v. 15). Cruquius would substitute ‘ Crispine' for ⁴ Hirpine! T.
Quintius Crispinus was consul with Drusus A.n.c. 745, and it is more probable that the
epistle above referred to was addressed to him than that this ode was. Finally to suppose
with most of the commentatore that this Hirpinus, whoever he was, was a nervous person
inclined to look with alai-m on the aspect of affairs, and especially sifi-aid of a descent of
the Scythians upon Italy, is as usual to mistake the character of the ode. That the dis-
turbances and designs of the distant tribes were troublesome to Rome and topice of con-
versation is enough to account for their introduction here, without supposing that Horace
or his friend attached more weight to them than other people.

ARGUMENT.

Never mind what distant nations are about, nor trouble thyself for the wants of life,
which wants but little: youth is going and age approaching: the flowers and the moon
are not always bright: why worry thyself for ever? Let us drink under the shade of
yonder nee. Mix wine, boy, and bring Lyde to sing to us.
