INTRODUGTION. xxiii

O. i. e.-This metro consiste of three Asclepiadem verses, such as
C. 1, and a Glyconean, as in O. 3. In Ο. i. 15. 24 and 36 a trochee
occurs in the first foot (see note). The other Odes are i. 24, 333 ii.

123 iii. 10, 163 iv. 5, 12.

Ο. i. 7 .—-This measure takes its name from Alcman, the lyric poet of
Sparta. It consists of two verses, of which the first is a complete hexa-
meter, and the second is made up of the four last feet of an hexameter.

Το this belong O. i. 28, and Epod. xii.

O. i. 8.-—There is no other Ode in this metre, which also consists of
two verses. The first consists of a dactyl and two trocb'eeS‚ or a trochee
and spondee, ,, υ υ 1 - υ Ι -, ::· This takes its name from Aristo-
phanes. The second is a dimeter verse, of which the first half consiste
of two trochees and a dactyl, with a long syllable added, and the second

half is the first reversed, thus:

· -ul-vl—uul—ll—uul-ul-‘c

Horace always has a spondee in the second place.

G. i. 9.—'.['his is the ordinary Alcaic met-re, in which each stanza con-
sists of four verses. The two first are divided thus:

ΞΙ-υΙ-υΙ-υυΙ-υε

though Horace usually substitutes a spondee for the second trochee,
the only exception being iii. 5. 17. The caesura usually falls after the
fifth syllable, to which rule exceptione will be found in O. i. 16. 21, 37.
5, 143 ii. 17. 21ς iv, 14. 17. This caesura the Greeks did not observo.
The syllable which forms the basis, as it is called, of the verse, is more
commonly long than short. It is usual to look upon the first part of
the verse as iambic. I have no doubt it is trochaic. The third verse is

also trochaic‚ consisting of a syllable (usually long) followed by four
trochees‚ a spondee being substituted by Horace for the second trochee.

The fourth verse consiste of two dactyls and two trochees.

G. i. 11.--'I'his is an Asclepiadem metro, rather peculiar. The divi-
sion to which we are guided by the ear seems to separate each verse into

three parte, as follows:

——l—vul-ll-uul—fl-uul—uu

This classes it with the ἀσυνάρτητα. These who resort to the division
by choriambics destroy the natural rhythm. To this belong i. 18; iv.
10.
