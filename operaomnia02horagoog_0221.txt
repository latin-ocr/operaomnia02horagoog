signify ⁴ upturned. The ⁴ s ’ in the Latin
word corresponds to the aspirato of the
Greek, as in ⁴ silva' and ὕλη. Compare
Aesch. (P. V. 10⁰6) = γυναικομίμοις ὑπ-
τιάσμασιν χερῶν. Aa to ⁴ nascente Luna'

⁴ hornus ' is ⁴ hornotinus! ⁴ Alumnus ’ oc-
curs above (C. iii. 18. 4). The epithet may
have been copied from Lucretius (ii. 1160),

lo. Devota] In the oak woods of Mount
Algidus (in Latium) and the pastures of
Alba were fed swine and cattle, especially
for sam-ifice. ⁴ Securim ’ (v. 12) is the read-
ing of many MSS. Orelli's zurich and one
of his Berne MSS. have ⁴ secures! Bentley
prefers the singular for euphony, and be-
cause ⁴ victima ’ is the singular number.

18. Non sumptuosa blandior hostia] 4 If
the hand be innocent that touches the altar,
not with sumptuous victim more welcome
deth it appease the angry Penates than with
picus meal and crackling salt! Bentley
sis-angely makes ⁴ hostia ’ the nominative
mse, in which he follows the Scholiast Por-
phyrion. Acron saw better, and Bentley
could not have read, or must have forgotten
his note, when he says, 44 uterque scholiastes
nominativi casus esse monuerunt.” The
productiori of the final 4 a ' in 4 sumptuosa ⁹
is not indefensible, but it is no defence to
say, as Bentley says, that Martia} has (v. 69.
3), 44 Quid gladium demens Romana stringis
in ora ?” for ⁴ str’ is a very different com-
bination from ‘ bl: and Horace would not
have taken this licence even with those let-
ters. Τίιο real defence has been given above
(C. iii. 5. 17, n.). But we need not trouble our-
selves about the matter, for 4 hostia' is no

doubt the ablativo case. Bentley supposes

ofl'ering, in which he follows what Lambinus
partly approved. It signi It

oue which Horace never uses nor any author
o’f the Augustan age, was the received read-
ing till Bentley adopted 4 mollivit: from
many of the best MSS„ which reading is
noticed by Cruquius, and was contained in
one of his Blandinian MSS, There can be
no doubt it is right, for, besides other con·
sideratione, the aoristic peu-fect is wanted to
coi-respond with 4 tetigit‚' and it gives the
best sense. When Bentley however argum
that if Horace had written 4 mollibit ⁹ some
at least of the grammarians would have
noticed such an unusual form, he ovet-looks
Acron, whose note is, 44 mollibit: plaoebit.”
Cunningham, out of oppositioni to Bentley,
proposes 4 mollirit‚’ for which there is some
aut ority.

2⁰. Ferre pio et saliente mica] This
means the saltcd meai-calte offered in sau-i-
fice. The Roman practice and the Greek
were different. The οὐλαὶ and οὐλοχύται
were the entire grain of barley mixed with
salt. The grain was not pounded by the
Greeks: by the Romans it was, and the salt
kneaded with it. So 44 Dant manibus
salsas ” (Aen. xii. 173). The crackling of
the §alt was a good omen. See Tibullus (iii.

44 At natum in curas hominum genus omina

Socrates was the first among the ancients
who took the view here given of the gods
and their offerings. His opinions are related
