Aut alius casus lecto te adfixit, habes qui
Adsideat, fomenta paret, medicum roget ut te
Suscitet ao gnatis reddat carisque propinquis.”
Non uxor salvum te vult, non filius; onmes

Vicini oderunt, noti, pueri atque puellae.

Miraris, quum tu argento post omnia ponae,
Si nemo praestet quem non merearis amorem?
An si cognatm, nullo natura labore

Quos tibi dat, retinere velis servareque amiooS,

Infelix operam perdas? ut si quis asellum

In Campo doceat parentem currere frenis,
Denique sit finis quaerendi, quumque habeas plus
Pauperiem metuas minus et finire laborem

44 Pauper Opimius argenti positi intus et
auri.” 4 Teutatum ' in the next line is the
word commonly used in connexion with
diseases. See Forcell.

80. At εἰ condoluit] 1 do not see the
necessity for understanding this ironically
with Heindorf and others. It seems to be
an argument urged by the avaricious man:
4 if you have money you will have anxious
friends to nurse you in sickness! Orelli
puts a (?) aster 4 propinquis,' and supposes
the meaning to be, 4 if you are sick will any
one nurse you and pray for your recovery?
Not one) This is not a bad interpretation.
But 4 at ' seems to be the introduction of a
reply, which use it so often serves.

81. lecto te adfinia] The old editions
nearly all have this reading. Most MSS..
and among them those of the Berne, have
‘ afflixit,’ which Lambinus and Cruquius
adopt, and the former declares the correct·
neas of that reading is not to be doubted.
He adopts the same in S. ii. 2. 79. He
takes it to have the same meaning here as
there, 4 illidere.' But it is not suitable in
either place. Bentley has aptly quoted
Seneca (Ep. 67): “Ago gratias senectuti
quod me lectulo affixit3 ” and Cicero in
Verr. Act. ii. l. 5. c. 7): “Pater gran 's
natu jam diu lecto tenebatur.''

85. pueri atque puellae] This, which
appears to he aproverbial sort of expression,
occurs again S. ii. 3. 130.

88. An εἰ common] 4 But say, if you
seek to retain and keep the affection of those
relations whom nature gives you without

95

any trouble of your own, would you lose
your labour, like the luckless fool that tries
to turnanassintoancer2’ ‘Nullo labore’
cannot go with 4 retinere,' as Dacier aud
others take it. The position of the words
forbid it, and ‘ operam perdas’ would have
no meaning. 4 Sine labore tuo' is Por-
phyrion’s explanation, and ‘ gratuitos' is
Acron's, though he notices the other. 4 At
si' is the reading of the Scholiasta, of the
old editions, and most MSS. 4 Ac si ¹ is in
others, and Heindorf adopts it. Various
other readings have been proposed, but 4 at’
or 4 an' are the best. Orelli adopts ‘an' on
the authority of his two oldest MSS.. those
of Berne and St. Galle. With either the
sentence should be pointed interrogatively.
Traiuing an ass to run in the Campus Mar-
tius among the thorough-hred horses that
were there exercised (see C. i. 8. 53 iii. 12.
8) was perhaps a.proverbial way os express-
ing lost labour. 44 Hoc de asino proverbium
aut proverbiale est ’' (Porph.). 4 Amicos ⁹
belongs to ⁸ cognatos' in the way Ι have
mualated it.

92. quumque habeas phaz] This is the
reading of all the MSS. Some editors have
adopted ‘ quoque' on the conjecture of
Muretus. Heindorf had that reading. Iu
his last edition it is altered to 4 quumque!
‘ The more you have you may sear poverty
less‚' would be an encouragement to board-
ing instead of a dissuasion. What Horace
says is, 4 Since you have more than others,

you should sear poverty less-⁹
