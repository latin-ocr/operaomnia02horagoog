HORATII FLAGOI

Maestum ae sollicitum est cantoris morte Tigelli.

Quippe benignus erat.

Contra hic, ne prodigus esse

Dicatur metuens, inopi dare nolit amico 5
Frigus quo duramque famem propellere possit.

Hunc si perconteris avi cur atque parentis
Praeclaram ingrata stringat malus ingluvie rem,
Omnia conductis coe'mens obsonia nummis,

Sordidus atque animi quod parvi nolit haberi,
Laudatur ab his, culpatur ab illis.

Respondet.

race’s expression 44 barathrumque macelli¹¹
(Epp. i. 15. 31). Itis not necessary to go
so far back as the age of the Scholiasta to
get at least as good guesses at the meaning
as these. Festus derives the name from
4 blatca,¹ which he says significa mud that
sticks to the shoes in dirty westher. (See
Forcell.) There are no means οι· arriving
at a nearer interpretation than that of the
Scholiasta, who say Horace means profligate
and abandoned persons in general. See
note ou S. ii. 3. 166.

6. propellere] The greater part of the
MSS. favour this reading, as Bentley ad-
mits, though he reads‘ depellere! 1 think

“carne pecudum propulsare famem adacti?
which comes vel’y near to‘ pro as
Bentley admits. Ven. (1483) has‘ propel-
lere. ¹ Nearly all the editions of the aix·
teenth and seventeenth centurias have the
other word. There' is not much to choose
between them. Orelli· s three Berne and
St. Galle MSS. have‘ propellere.

adopts the interpretation of qu uius¹ Scho-
liast, who says the metaphor is qtaken from
the stripping of trees of their leaves. But
‘stringere' means 4ιο grasp, ¹ and Horace
says this man put all his estate in his belly.

12. Fufidius] of this person the Scho-
liasta tell us nothing but what the Satire
tells, that he was 44 ‘avarus quidam foene-
rator. ¹¹ what resemblance Orelli can see
between this person and the Fufidius re·

Piso (c. 35) it is hard ιο imagine. The
words‘ vappa 'and‘ nebulo¹ have been ex-
plained above (S. 1. 104).
