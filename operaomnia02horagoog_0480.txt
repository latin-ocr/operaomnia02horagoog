Lenta feret pituita. Vides ut pallidus omnis
Coena desurgat dubia! Quin corpus onustum
H esternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una,
Atque affigit humo divinae particulam aurae.

Membra dedit vegetus praescripta ad munia surgit.

Hic tamen ad melius poterit transcurrere quondam,
Sive diem festum rediens advexerit annus,

Seu recreare volet tenuatum corpus, ubique

Accedent anni et tractari mollius aetas

com the mental disoeses produced by
the conflict of vicious opinions with the
diaorders of the Ιιοιίγ,ι ‘quum sanguis cor·
ruptus est aut pituita redundat aut bilisss’
'l'he first and third syllables οἰ· pituita’ are
long, the second therefore here coalesces
with the third. ⁴ Coena dubia’ is an ex-
pression copied from Terence, and meana

79. Atque affiyit humo] This is the
reading of all the old editions and the
Scholiasta, together with the great majority
of the MSS„ and all the oldest and best.
Lambinus, on the authority as he says of
twelve M 88 hus‘ afflig-it? and Bentley has
defended that reading in along note. He
says the copyists invariably make mistakes
between these two words, and that here it
will require a ghost from the shades below
ιο decide the reading. It appears to me
that ‘'affl igit humo,' gwhich would signify
dashes to the ground, does not express
Horace' s meaning, and that the examples
Bentley quotes in support of that phrase
have no resemblance ιο this passage. for
instance, Ovid (Met. xii. 139): —

“Quam super impulsam resupino pectore

vi ιιιῗῑεινιὲιίι terraeque afflixit Achillea?

90

If‘affiixit’ in this case expressed then-me
meaning as the text, then‘ vi multa vertit’
should be analogous ιο ‘praegravatss which
it is not, and the latter word is incompatible
with the notion of dashing to the ground.
you cannot be said to weigh a thing down
and dash it down' ιιι the same breath. Any
one who remembers the words of David,
“yM soulcleaveth tothegroundl’ willsee
how ymuch more force there ia in ‘affigit'
than ⁸ affligit-⁹ 'rba debauch might have
been saidto dash the aoul ιο theground,
the state ot· the body consequent on the
debauch can only be said to keep it there.
The same sense, though in a different con-

nexion, is conveyed by Cicero’ s words (de
Senect. c. xxi.)=· ‘Est enim animus caeles·
tis ex altissimo domicilio depressus et
quasi demersus in terram, locum divinae
naturae aeternitatique contrarium? which
serves also to illustrate ‘divinae particulam
aurae. ' This expression has an archaic as·
pect,and may have been taken from some
preceding writer, but 1 do not find any
passage quoted from which it can be said
tohavebeeneo pi,ed andlknowofnone.
