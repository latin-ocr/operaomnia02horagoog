CARMEN XXIV.
About ΛΑΜ). 728.

This ode iz of the nme elus and m probably written about the same time ns tho
early ones of the thixd book, ι’, e. about mmo. 728. It dealt with the lioeutious ahusen
of the timeo, md points indirectly to Augustae as the real reformor of them, aa in the
second ode of the first book. Horace is never more powerfiss than when he bundles theno
subjecta. whether from a wish to plenae his patron οι· from a genuine sense of the
depravity of hin age, he seems to put on all his strength md to use hin happiest lnngmge
when he is attacking it. The variety of inunges and illustratione in this odeis very remark-
able, and they inre particularly well chosen and original. There is none that exhibite
noraoe’a peculim· style more completely than this doen.
