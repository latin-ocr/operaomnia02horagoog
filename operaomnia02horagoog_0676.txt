EPISTULARUM Ι. 20.

651

Odisti claves et grata sigilla pudico;
Paucis ostendi gemis et communia-lauda,
Ν on ita nutritus. Fuge quo descendere gestiS. 5

N on erit emisso reditus tibi.

“ Quid miser egi?

Quid volui 3” dices ubi quis te laeserim et scis
In breve te cogi cum plenus languet amator.
⁸ Quodsi non odio peccantis desipit augur,

Carus eris Romae donec te deserat aetam

10

Contrectatus ubi manibus sordescere vulgi
coeperis, aut tineas pasces taciturnus inerteS,
Aut fugies Uticam aut vinctus mitteris Ilerdam.
Ridebit monitor non exaudime, ut ille

Qui male parentem in rupes protrusit asellum

15

Iratus: quis enim invitum servare laboret?

Hoc quoque te manet, ut pueros elementa docentem
Occupet extremis in vicis balba senectus.

oum tibi sol tepidus plures admoverit aures,

3. odisti claves] The ‘capsae’ or ‘scrinia’
(S. i. 4. 21, n.) were locked, or scaled, or
both3 and women and young lul-sons were
locked or scaled up in their chambers that
they might not get into mischief, which
restraint Horace says they„ liked if they
were chaste. He professes to reproach his
book for being tired of staying at home, and
being shown only to his friends, and want-

it. There can be no doubt that what is
here distinctly said of the Epistles is true
of the other works of Horace, that they
were shown to his friends, and circulated
privately before they were collected and

ublished.

p 7. ubi quis te taeter-it ,·] The MSS. vary
between ⁴ quis ' and ⁴ quid! Bentley pre-
fers the latter. Comm. Cruq. writes, ⁴⁴ post-
quam te aliquis reprehenderit.'' He there-
fore probably had ¹ quis,' which I prefer.
⁴ In breve te cogi,' aa applied to the book,
means that it will be rolled up and put into
a case, and not taken out again. The meta-
phorical language is kept up in the follow-
ing words, in ⁴ peccantis,' and in the notion
of its being thrown aside when the fresh-
ness of youth shall have lest it.

9. Quodsi non odio peccantis] ⁴ But if
the prophet is not blinded by his aversion
to the offender,' that is, if Ι am not led by
my aversion to your wantonness to pro-
phesy too harshly of your fate. ‘Aetas ' is
used for any time of life according to the

layAut suyt'er Uticam] Yon will be
shipped off to Utica (in Libya), or to Ilerda
(Lerida) in Spain, or any where else in the
remote provinces, tied u as a bundle of
goods (⁴ vinctus '), and {shall laugh, for
what is the use of trying to save such a
wilful thing? as the driver said when his ass
would go too near the edge of the precipice,
and he drove him over in a passion. It is
not known where this fable comes from.
Compare A. Ρ. (467), “ Invitum qui servat,
idem facit occidenti. '

· 18. ‘balba senectam] This keeps up the

schools in the back streete (see S. i. 10. 75,
n.). His writings came very soon to take
their place with Homer and virg-il in all the
schools. See Juvenal (vii. 226) 2-—

“ Quot stabant pueri, cum totus decolor
Flffi, et haereret nigro fuligo Maroni.'’

19. Cum tihi eol tepidus] In the heat
of the day, and before dinner in the batha,
people read to themselves or one another.
See Martial (iv. 8. 7), ‘⁴ Hora libellorum
decima est, Eupheme, meorum.” It is not
easy to see the connexion of this line with
what goes before. It is something of a
contradiction. With ¹ Me libertino natum
patre‚’ compare S. i. 6. 6, 46, 47.
