SATIRARUM Ι. 10.

Quamque poetarum seniorum turba ; sed ille,
Si foret hoc nostrum fato dilatus in aevum,
Detereret sibi multa, recideret omne quod ultra

Perfectum traheretur, et in versu faciendo

Saepe caput scaberet vivos et roderet ungues.
Saepe stilum vertas iterum quae digna legi sint
Scripturas, neque te ut miretur turba laboreS‚

Contentus paucis lectoribus.

Vilibus in ludis dictari carmina malis?

An tua demens

N on ego ς nam satis est equitem mihi plaudere, ut audax
Contemptis aliis explosa Arbuscula dixit.

Men moveat cimex Pantilius, aut cruciet quod

Vellicet absentem DemetriuS, aut quod ineptus

Horace
Orelli says the latter notion involves an im·
possibility, and therefore an absurdity, which
does not follow.

72. Saepe stilum venas] ‘Stilum vertere'
was the conventionsl phrase for erasing
what had been written, one end of the iron
pen (stilus) being broad like the end of a
chisel, for the purpose of obliterating the
letters made upon the wax tablet by the
sharp end, which they called‘ acumen.'

75. Vilibus in ludis] Such schools as
Flavius' perhaps, if poetry was ever taught
there, or in those cheap schools' ιιι the back
streete mentioned in Epp-i.20. 18. The
word⁴ dictari' refers to the practice of the
teacher reading out a passage for the pupil
to repeat after him, one of the earliest steps
in education being accurate pronunciation.
This is what Mam-obius means when speaking
of Virgil he asks, ‘⁸ nunc quia cum Marone
nobis negotium est, respondeas volo utrum
poetae hujus opera instituendis tantum
pueris idonea judices, an alia illis altiora
inesse fatearis. Videris enim mihi ita adhuc
Virgilianos habere versus qualiter eos
pueri magisztzqs praa-‹zlegssfibus mfbffim„

might have said either, though

“Versus scr-ibere me parum severos,

Nec quos praelegat· ιιι schola magister,
Corneli, quereris!

Orelli explains ‘dictari' here of the boy
repeating what he has learnt, and in Epp-
ii. l. 71, where it is obviously said of the
teacher, he explains it of his repeating the

words to be taken down by the scholar and Jacobs, Lect. Ven.

then got by heart. Comm. Cruq. and many
of the editors understand it here of the
master. The words ‘ canere,' ⁴ cantare,'
which are frequently applied to the recita-

tion of the pnpil, show that the modulation
of the voice was a primu-y consideration· ιιι
teaching. To help this 1 have no doubt
was one principsl purpose of the master' s
reciting to his scholare, which was done
quite at the beginning, and probably before
the boys could write; whence Ovid says
(ex Pont. i. 2. 126), ‘⁴ Os tenerum pueri
balbumque poeta figmatss’ It was a good
mm? ἕξοιξξῖἷε ῗξέἒέπ {idigini
practice which might be more generally
revived, for nothing can be worse than the
way in which boys usually read or repeat
their lessons in our schools.

77. explosa Arbuscula] This actress has
been mentioned before, S. 2. 2, ιι. As she,
when she was hissed off the stage, said she
cared nothing for the rest of the spectatore,
and was satisfied if she plessed the front
benches (the equites), so Horace says he
only wants to be read in the better sort of
schools, where that class of people sent
their sons.

78· cimex Panium] This pen-son, if it ’

be a real name, is quite unknown. Comm.
Cruq. says, “ nomen est vilis poetae et
malevolentis,” which is only guthered from
the text. A more contemptible animal
could not have been chosen to liken the man
to, whether forits odour, its skulking, οι· its
sting. Sothat δήγματα κυρίων, λιι θρόδιιιτναι
κόρεις, seem to have been proverbial ex-

pressions for the calumnies of such people.
