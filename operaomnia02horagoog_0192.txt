OARMINUM III. 9. 167

Neglegens ne qua populus laboret. 25
Parce privatus nimium cavere:

Dona praesentis cape laetus horae et
Linque severa..

CARMEN IX.

This is an elegant trifle (⁴⁸ an incomparablo dialognel' Buttmann cells it), ehowing the
prooem of reconcilintion between two lovers, in which the desire for peteo appears in the
minist of pretended indifferenoe, and mutual jedousy‘ ιε mode the means of re- union. The
subject could hardly bave been more delioeoely handled. whether the treatment of it ιο
original or not, it u impossible ω say. It iz just such ι subject u one might expect to
find among the erofic poetry of the Greeks. One of Buttmann' s romulu with reference
to this ode is well worth quoting. “Tine audente had the skin to construet auch poema,
eothztenehspeeehtellsusbywhomitiespokem butwelettheeditors.treat us all our
lives aa schoolbm ond inter-line such dialogum aster the fnehion of om· phys with the
names. To their sedulity we are indebted for the alumnum of the lyrioel name Lydia
with the name Horatius in this exquisite work of αις and yet, even in an English poem,
ve should be offended at seeing Collins by the eide of Phyllis.’' Such offenoe the offi-
ciousnees of editors has already obtruded upon the readers of that poet3 and the practice,
which justly offendo the good toste of this discerning scholar, had probably its origin
among Horoee’a very earliest &maiheu-s. The objection to the practice is, that, like
other umuthorized interpretatione, it takes away from the artistic character of Hornoe’s
poems, ond substitutos for it a supposititium reality at var-ianoe with the passionlees tone
of the worke- As vorke os akiu they are very elegant: aa vorke of feeling they munt
always rank low.

ARGUMENT.

While thou clidat love me better than all the world, no pn'noe m happy us 1.

While Lydio was dean-eet to thee of women, the name of nia m not no noble as mine.

Chloe the meet einger ie my queen: for her Ι would gladly die.

Calais loves me and I love him = for him 1 would gladly die.

Whatiftheoldlove were tounioeusagnin, if Chloe were matoffnudtumedsrommy
door, and 1 openetl it to Lydio again?

'I'hongh Calais is handsome, and thou art fickle aud pmiomte as the stormy sea, 1 would
live and die with theo.

Dormc gratus eram tibi

N eo quisquam potior brachia candidae
Cervici juvenis dabat,

Persarum vigui rege beatior.
