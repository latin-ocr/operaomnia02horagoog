your birth, while our
and Messalla are elabonting their speeches
in their pure mother tongue, —wculd you, 1
say, prefer mining up a foreign· Jargon with
ffi Quam-„355 ⁰ ffatim&
tion of verses, on such themes as Lucilius
chose, on a par with the gravity of forensic
speaking, and aske why if the man would
not apply the rulo to the latter he should
do so to the former.

· 28. oum Pedius causas] It is doubted
whether Poplicola should be taken with
Pedius or Corvinus. The son or grandson
emulis, sisterofJuliusCaoear, was Q. Pe-
dius, who died in the year ofhis consulship,
a.u.c. 711. This Pedius, therefore, could
not have been the orator of the text. He
had a son Quintus, of whom history says
nothing but that he was the father of
Q. Pedius, who was born dumb and, having
been taught psinting through the means of
Messalla Corvinus his ltinsman‚ became
eminent as an artist- These are all the
Pediiofthis age thatweknow cf; and if
any of these was the orator, -it must have
been the son cf Q. Pedius, and either grand-
son or great grandson ofJulia. His family
’were connected by marriage with the Mes-
sallae, but there is no record of the cogno·
men Poplicola belonging to any of them.
Neither' is there any reason that 1 know of
tosuppose itwas borneby Messalla Corvinus,
to whom Horace here alludes. (See C. iii. ²
21. lut..) He had a brother by adoption
named Gellius Poplicola, and it was a cog-
nomen of the Valeria gens, to which Messalla
belonged, but he is never so called himself.
Acron takes Poplicola with Pedius, and
Ξῗὲὲῒ :¹32¹ {w ο.. ῖῗέἱῗῖιῗῗέὶὶβηῗῖῗ
that Quintius Pedius, the father of the
dumb ',nter adopted a brother of Mes·
salla,w ce he wascalled Pedius. Esus

great oratore Pedius takes Poplicola with Corvinus, as in S. 5.

Fuscuffl I do not know how the question
is to be decided, iu the absence of more
distinct information about Pedius. ln re-
spect to Messalla⁹s religious rever-cuce for
his mother tongue, the Scholiasta write (the
words are those of Comm. Cmq„ but Porph-
tells the same story), “a Graecis vocabulis
ita abhorruerunt ut Messalla σχοινοβὰτην
Lan'no ⁴ funambulum ⁹ reddiderit, ex Te·
rentio in Hecyra, ubi ait, Funambuli eodem
accessit expectatio 3⁹⁹ which Estre interprete
thus ς thatin the place in question (Hecyra,
Pml.v.26)⁹1'erencewrote originally‘ ‘Schoe-
nobatae eodem acoessit ’,o ”and that
Messalla substituted the word‘ funambuli,
which was retained in all the subsequent
copies. Quintilian describes Messalla (x. 1.
113) as “orator nitidus et candidus et
quodammodo prae se ferens in dicendo
nobilitatem suam. ⁹⁹ And Horace speaks ·
again of his eloquence A. P. 370. His
with Horace began in Brutus’
army, and continued unbroken till Horace⁹ s
eath.

‘canusiumss see S. 5. 91. It was one of
those Greek towns which retained longest
and most purely the language of its founders,
as we may suppose from the text.

day, and licensed plays before they were
acted. Itappearsfromaletterofcicemto
Marius (Ad Fam. vii. 1) that he was ap-
pointed to that duty by Cn. Pompeius, on
the opening-of his theatre, Amuc 699· he
must therefore have discharged it for a great
many years, since he is mentioned again in

theArs Poefica (v. ³87), though it is not
