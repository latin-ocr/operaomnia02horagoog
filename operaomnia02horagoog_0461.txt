436 HORATII FLAGOI SATIRARUM Ι. 10.

with him. The epithet ‘ turgidus’ applies to his person, and is explained by the descrip-
tion given of him in the above place, ‘⁴ pingui tentus omaso.” He is said to have murder-ed
Memnon, and it is generally said that this refers to a translation he is supposed to have
made of the Aethiopis of Arctinus, one of the cyclic poets, in which Memnon was one of
the principal heroes. Dacier suggests that he wrote a tragedy with this title, to which
notion the following lines give some probability. Horace says that Furius, like some
rude artists, had made a figure of Rhenus with a head of clay, refer-ring to the statues by
which the different river gods were represented, and to some description this poet had
given of the sources of the Rhine, probably in the above poem on the Gallie war. There
is a very different representation of Rhenus on a medal of Drusus, in Oiselius' Thesaurus,
Pl. 24. 6, where hc appears as a majestic figure, reclining with his lest arm raeting on his
urn, and in his right hand a reed partly broken ; which latter symbol appears to have been
familiar to ovid, for he writes, describing the triumph of Tiberius, am. 12 (ex Pont. iii.
⁴' Μ) “ “Squalidus immissos fiam sub arundine tninoe

Rhenus et infectas sanguine portet aquas.”

⁸ Defingo' is to fashion out, and differs little from ⁴ fingo ι’ ⁴ diffingo’ (C. i. 35. 39, n.) is to
break up and fashion ancw- Nevertheless some MSS. and editions have ‘ diffingit’ here.
Dillenbr. says this word ‘⁶ haud dubie reprehensionem continet ut simile verbum de-
formare.” 1 do not agree with him. Is ⁶ deformare’ were substituted it would either
have the same meaning that 1 have given ιο ⁴ defingit‚’ or it would signify disfigured,
which sense the passage will not bear. Tbere is a chapter in Gellius (xviii. 11) in which
he defends Furius from the adverse judgment of Caesellius Vindex, who pronounced him
affected, and said he had spoilt the Latin tongue by the invention of new words, of smne
of which he gives specimens. The heading of the chapter makes this Furius to be Aulus
Furius of Antium ς but as he was a poet held in high esteem, and one whom Virgil largely
imitated (see Macrob. Saturn. vi. l), it has been assumed that ‘⁴ Furii Antiatis,'’ in the
lemma to Gellius' chapter, is a corrupt reading (Weichert, Ροὲι. Lat. p. 350 sqq.). What-
ever the merita of Furius of Antium may have been, it is possible he may have used the
expressions Gellius quotes, and they would not be more or worse blemishes than one
might find in most poema of the same length (his Annals extended ιο upwards of eleven
books) ς and 1 see no good reason for supposing Furius Bibaculus to be meant. It is
curious however that one of the affectatione ascribed ιο the poet Gellius refers ιο, is
‘⁸ quod terram in lutum versam ‘ lutescere’ dixerit.” lf Bibaculus were the author of
this expression we might imagine that it had stuck to his name, and that Horace usoe the
expression ‘luteum caput' as referring ιο this proverbial reproach. What else is known of
him will be found in his life in the Diot. Biog.; the author of which notice thinks Horace
might have shown more respect and forbearance towards the aged Furius. He asa-ibes
his ridicule to various possible motives, principally perhaps to the cirtrumstanoe that Furius'
writings “ were stuffed with insulta against the Caesars” (see Tacit. Ann. iv. 34), and
Catullus he thinks incurred Horace's hostility for the same reason. But Catullus is only
once mentioned in Horace, and there no hostility is shown towards him (see above v.
19, n.). And if Furius was so abusive in his attacks upon Augustus, Horace’s patron and
friend, there would have been no cause for surprise if he had handled him more severely
than he has done. But Augustus, like Julius Caesar, passed over those sort of attacks
with contempt, and we need not suppose Horace was much influenced by them3 though

we may believe that the opponents of the Caesars would be among the most prominent of
Horace's detractura, to whom he is here replying.
