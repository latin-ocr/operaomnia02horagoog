On you will be visited your fathers' guilt, Ο Romans, unless ye shall restore the worship
and acknowledge the sovereign power of the gods. Already have they afflicoed our
land; twice the Parthian bath checked our arms, the barbarian bath well nigh destroyed
us in the midst of our atrise, the age is so fuu of shameless adulterx and lasciviousness.
Not from such parents were born the conquerors of Pyrrhus, Antiochus, aud Hannibal,
the manly offspring of soldiers who had handled the plough and carried the fnggot.
So doth time spoil all things. Our fathers were not as their satha-s, nor we as they3
and our children shall be worse than ourselves.

1. immeritum] I do not see the difficulty
said to exist in this word. The ode is ad·
dressed, like the others, ‘virginibusp ueris-
que, ’and they could not be said to pbe re-
sponsible for the guilt of the civil was-s
pelion) just brought to a close· but if they
ailed to do their duty’ m restoring the tem-
ples, and so repairing the consequences of
the vars, they must be prepared to resp
the fruita of them m the disp leasure of the
gods. Suetonius, as before pmentioned (C.
ii. 15, Introduction), in his life of Augustus,
relatas how he applied himself to the resto-
ration of the sacred buildings, which Ovid
also recorda (Fast. ii. 59, sqq.), and virgil
:ffidigeteo ιιι-,ξε Ιέἒὲζάἧῖζίῗιξε ῗιῗίιιῗιιίρίι · 3⁰⁰

“At Caesar triplicidnvectus Romana tri-

Mblelilii'dtodis Italis {otum immortale sacra-

21:22⁸ ter centum totam delubra per
urbem! ' (Aen. viii. 714, sqq.)

4 Delubra,’ mere way-side ehi-ines, each con-
taining an image or an altar or both,
must not be confounded with 4 templa!
Tiberius followed up the work that Augustus
began (Tac. Λιιιι. ίί. 49)= “Iisdem tempo-
ribus deum aedes vetustata aut igni abolitas,

coeptasque ab Augusto dedicavit.” The
temp les he built or completed were three ιιι
number, dedicated to Liber, Libera, and
Ceres, to Flora, audtoJuno. SeeC. ii. 15.
20. ³8. ii. 2. 104.

2. Romane,] Horace uses the same form
against ‘Hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane,
caveto” (S. i. 4. 85); and virgil likewise,

44Τιι regere imperio pop pulos, Romane, me-
menm'' (Aen. vi. 852). Livy osten ex-
presses himself so, as Quintilian observes
(Inst. viii. 6)st ‘Maxime in ovando valebit
numerorum illa libertast nam et Livius
saepe sic dicit‘ Romanus proelio victor-,⁹
cum Romanos vicisse significat.”

6. Principium] See note above on C.
4. 4l. Orelli here quotes Livy (45. 39) ι
44 Majores vestri omnium magnarum rerum
et principia exorsi ab Dis sunt et finem sta-
tuerunt.”

9. Monaeses et Paeon· manns] Pacorus
was son of the Parthian king, Arffices xlv„
and appointed by his father-to command the
army against the Romans in the place of
Surenas, who defeated Crassus a. ιι. c. 701,
and whom Pacorus put to death. He was ns-
sociaoed with the renegade Labienus, and
overran Syria aud a great part of Λεία Μί-
nor, while M. Antonius was amusing himself
with Cleopatra. Who Monaeses was is not
