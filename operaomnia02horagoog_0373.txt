These things were eeteu with 0 drsught of

Cic. de Oret. i. 69, “Citere Paeanem sut

Bocche ' is not Latin, 01111 00ὶο where we
011011 meet with such 0 phrase 00 ⁴ cite-re

place in the verse is not enough to account
for the lengthening of the syllable, 00 Orelli
ssys it is. ⁶ Io Bacchae ⁹ is found 111 001110
MSS„ being introduced evidently to seve
the metro. Such was the cry of the Bec-
chsnsls in Euripides' play, v. 576,—

Compare the use of ⁴ modo ⁹ end ⁶ admodum ’
