SATIRARUM Ι. 1.

325

Qm fit, Maecenas, ut nemo quam sibi sortem

Seu ratio dederit seu fors objecerit illa

Contentus vivat, laudet diversa sequentes!

“ Ο fortunati mercatores !'' gravis annis

Miles ait multo jam fractus membra labore. 5
Contra mercator, navem jactantibus Austris:

“ Militia est potior.

1. quam sibi cortem] See note on Ο.
i. 9. 14 asto sors' and⁴ fors-⁹ Thesetwo
are opposed ss effect and cause, the condi·
tion aud that which produces it. ‘'Fors
and ‘ratio' areopposed asaccident and
demgn, —that which a man cannot help,
and that which he carves out for himself.

2. illa] Pes quotes several MSS. which
have ‘'ulla for ‘ina’ and he adopts that
reading as ‘elegantius et plenius vulgato:
quoting Cicero in Verr. Act-¹ ii. 1. 5, c. 3·

“Neque ego ullam in partem disputo,'⁹
where he says ‘’ullsm is for‘ alterno-am!
But it is not so: Cicero means he in ιιο
Ἥαᾱξεὶξιυὶῒοιξιοπῗγαῗ ριιιιὶῃοιὲΙαιί-ῗγὝΟιξειῶ
says, as referring to‘ quam!

3. laudet] This sense of ‘laudat-e,
‘felicem praedicare: μακαρίζειν, is not
given by Forcellini. It is repeated below,
v. 9, and in v· 109, where it occurs ini
combination with, and as equivaleut ιο,
4 probare.⁹ Heindorf quotes two places in
Silius (i. 395): 44 Felix heu! nemorum et
vitae laudandus opacae 3⁹⁹ (iv. 260) “lauda-
bnt leti juvenem.'⁹ So Cicero (de Am. c. vii.)
says, 44 Ex quo illorum laeata mors videtur,
horum vita laudabilisfl

laudet diversa sequentes f] This isbriefly
expressed lor⁶ sed quisque laudet,⁹ as Hein-
dorf remarks. The irregularity is almost
imperceptible3 the absence of a nominative
is so little felt ιιι such a position that any
language will allow of its omission. See
Plato (Rep. ii. p.,366 n): τῶν γε ἄλλων
οὐδεὶς ἑκὼν δίκαιος ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ ἀνανδρι 'ac-—
ψέγ ει τὸ ἀδικεῖν ἀδυνατῶν αὐτὸ ρδρᾶν.
cic. de Or. ii. 142 “Nemo extulit eum
verbis qui ita dixisset, ut qui adessent in-
telligerent quid dixisset, sed contempsit eum

ments, the positive element which is con-
tained iu the former is osten carried on in
the mind so as ιο affect the latter, as in
those sentences which are coupled by 4 nec'
and ‘et,' οὔτε and τε. ‘Nemo vivit' is
4 quisque non vivit) Every one must be

Quid enim, concurritur: horae

4. mannis] Iseenoresson for
⁴adopting, with Orelli, Jahn⁹ s limitation,

“Significat poeta non annos vitae sed annos
miliu'se? virgil says (Aen. ix. 246)’4 ‘Hic
ᾙὲῗ μ’ἓῗθᾞξθοέἒωὲἓ mmmm}
words applied to old age, as any one knows
who has read cioero’ s treatise· , and βαρύς
is equally common in the same connexion.
That Augustus' soldiers got their discharge
before they were fifty is nothing to the
Pfflt·n.}.0ffl·tgt'kss„:ss¹ffin ἷῗέἓ
of peace and ene. Horace, in his own
campaigning, had heard many a veteran ιιο
doubt grumhling at his condition· and if he
wrote* annis, 'he meant age, not service.
Lucan puts such complaints into the lips of

Julius Caesar’ s soldiers (v. 273, ειμι-ι)

Finis uis quaeritur armis?
Quid satis est, si oma parum. ² jam
Inffigffqssnffianua et inanes cerne la-

certos.

Usus abest vitae: bellis consumpsimus

aevum.⁹'

‘Minis' is a conjectus-al reading which
some editors have adopted, and Heindorf
says it is specious (schmeichelend), but it is
not general enough to be admitted, and the
MSS. are unanimously against it.

7. quid enim, concurritur. ·] 1 have not
inserted the usual note of interrogation
after 4 enim! 4 Quid ⁹ and 4 quid euim ⁹ are
each used as introductory ιο something that
illustrates, οι· explains, οι· accounts for what
has Just been said. They introduce an
example, οι· they carry οιι the flow of an
argument, or something of that sort. It is
not difficult to see how that conventional
sense may have become connected with the
word‘ quidss but to explain it by an ellipse,
as‘ ‘quid est enim quod contradici queat?
nonne concurritur. θ’ (Heindorf, ) and so ιο
point the words as to indicate that meaning,
even if that explanation were correct, which
1 doubt, is no more desirable than to break
up any other sentence and reduce it to its
possible elements. Any language would be
