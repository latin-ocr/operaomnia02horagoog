beautiful passage). Silius (xii. 543) makes
nin hide herself in the bosom of her sponse
as Hannibal sppmsches the Anio. Thet
there were two legende therefore, in this ts
in most ceses, must be admitted. Cru-
quius' commentator gete rid of the difficulty
in true Scholiast fnshion by saying that
Ilia was buried by the banks of the Anio,
which carried her remeius away and washed
them into the 'ribei-3 md hence she was said
to have been married to the Tiber. Servius
(on Aen. i. 27 7) reum-ks on Horsce’s version,
which he says is supported by other writers.
claudian is one. speaking of the Tiber he
says,

(In Pmb. et olyb. Cous. 224.) Jove may
be supposed to have disap roved the pre-
sumption of the river-god, ecause he had
resen-ved the task of expiation for other

21. cives acuisse serrum] ⁴ inter ω’ or
⁴ in semetipsos ' is reedily understood.
Mitsoherlich and others make ⁴ audiet ecu-
isse’ s prophecy, ⁴ shall henr them sharpen,'
whereas it should be rendered ‘ shall hear
of their having sharpenod! Horace is not
predicting what is to be, but lamenting
what has been.

Pei-siens, Medea, and Parthians ere names
sreely intel-changed by Horace. The growth
of the Parthian power from the condition
of nn insignificent dependency to the ab·
sorption of nearly the whole of the vast
empire of the Seleucidee, is a question of
history which need not be entered upon
here. It will be borne in mind however
with reference to the above confusion of
names that the Parthian empire, at the
time Horace wrote, extended nearly from
the Indus to the Roman province of Syrin3
endthatthel‘erthienswere inthehsbitof

ode. Although the name of Au , assist-
ed by their own disputes, did something to-
wards keeping them in check, they were
held by the Romans to be their most for·
midable enemies, as the readers of Hor-aee
wiu easily perceive. Augustus meditated

and the Romans never till the reign of
Trajan gained any successes against them.

24. Rara juventam] It took years of
peace and the enactment of stringent mar-
riage-lam to restore the populetion of
Rome, which was thinned not only by
bloodshed bnt by indifferenoe to marriage
and laxity of mornls. (See Asticle J ulia
