’ HORATII FLAOOI

Garrulus atque piger scribendi ferre laborem,

Scribendi recte: nam ut multum nil moror.
Crispinus minimo me provocat:
Accipiam tabulam detur nobis locus, hora,

Ecce,
‘⁶ Accipe, si vis
15

Custodes; videamus uter plus scribere possit.''
“ Di bene fecerunt inopis me quodque pusilli
Finxerunt animi, raro et perpauca loquentis,
At tu conclusas hircinis follibus auras,

prehends defecta of teste as well as style.
44 Erat quod tollere velles '' is oddly inter-
preted by the Scholiasta 44 ex quibus sunt
nonnulla quae velis inde excerpere et pro
tuis hahere '' (Porph.). “ Erat quod velles
imitari ” (Acron). Cruquius' Scholiast gives
the same interpretation. Heindorf adopts
that notion, which would not otherwise
have been noticed here. Quintilian did not
so understand the words when, differing
with Horace he says (x. 1. 93): 44 Ab
Horatio dissentio qui Lucilium fluere lutu-
lentum et esse aliquid quod tollere possis
putat,” where he uses the word 4 possis ’
for 4 velles,' quoting {rom memory. Horace's

· word 4 velles sues the meaning of 4 tollere ’

4 to remove,’ even if the whole context did
not do sc. 4 You would wish for the credit
of the author to remove it.'

‘ Piger ferre ' is aGree construction common
in the oda, but not so in the lan of
the Satires. (See C. i. 1. 18, n.) In C. iv.
14. 22, we have ‘impiger’ in the same
construction z “ Impiger hostium vexare
turmas. ’

14. Crispinus minimo] See S. i. 1. 120, n.
4 Minimo me provocat ' Porphyrion inter-
prets thusz ⁴‘ Sensus ex proverbiali con-
suetudine ductusg solemus enim dicere
minimo me digito provocat cum volumus
quem intelligi tantum valere minimo digito
quantum alius totis viribusf' Acron and
Comm. Cruq. have the same idle talk. The
proverb is probably their own invention.
Erasmus, however, in his book of Proverbs,
takes it up as meaning a contemptuous sort
of challengeg and Lambinus also follows
the Scholiasta: Crnquius does not. Bentley
quotes a Scholium which gives the right
sense. 44 Minimo provocare dicuntur ii qui

odds’ is the meaning according to this
interpretation, which Bentley adopts, as far
as concertis the wager, but substitutes as
his own conjecture ⁴ nummo' for ‘ minimo,’

and the Scholiasta and editors are equally
sog and, is that reading be right, the inter-
pretation above given must be right too.
1 do not see the connexion between this
e and ‘nummo te addicem' (S. ii.
ὅ. 109), which Bentley quotes in snp-
port of his alteration, and on the strength
of which Orelli considers it a plausible con·
15. Accipiam tabulam] Here Bentley
follows the reading of some MSS. which
have 4 accipe jam,’ and he cannot help won-
dering that nearly all the editors should
have taken up 4 accipiam ε’ 4 jam ’ he thinks
exhibita the eagerness of the challenger, and
his {ear lest Horace, if he let him go on
this occasion, should slip out of the contest
altogether. For all this the passage affor-ds
no wari-ant. There is no eagerneas or
haste,—nothing more than a polite chal-
lenge to see which could write most verses
in a given time. 4 Take tablets if you
plesse, and 1 will take them too.' The
omission of the personal pronoun to ex·
press antithesis is nothing in familiar talk
where there could be no mistake. 4 Cus-
wlges’ are umpires to see there is no foul

binus, against all the MSS„ introduced the
reading ‘ loquentem,' which Bentley has
adopted, and others aster him. The re-
ceived reading is very natural, and I see no
occasion for alter-ing it. 4 The gods have
done me a kindness in making me of a poor
and unpretending disposition that speaks
but seldom, and very little at a time-⁹ This
is intelligible. It is Horace's reply to the
challenge, which he declines.
