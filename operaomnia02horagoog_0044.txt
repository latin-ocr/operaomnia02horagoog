CARMINUM Ι. 4.

Nunc decet ant viridi nitidum caput impedire myrto

Aut flore terrae quem serunt solutae.

Nunc et in umbrosis Fauno decet immolare lucis,
Seu poscat agnam sive malit haedum.
Pallida Mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas

Regumque turres,

Ο beate Sesti,

Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam. 15
J am te premet nox fabulaeque Manes

and probability is greatly in favour of the
latter. Why should the copyists have
changed ‘visit’ into ‘urit?' The reverse
would be intellig-ible. That it is said of
Venus (Ο. iii. 28. 1³). ‘⁸ Paphon junctis
risit oloribus.” is no argument at all. Ovid
(Post. iv. 473) has ‘⁸ Antraque Cyclopum,
podtis mata caminis,” which was possibly
imitated stom this.

9. nitidum] zze. with oil. There is ιιο
ιιεοεεέιγ to suppose, with Rutgersius, that
this refero to the practice of matrona bath-
ing with myrtle crowns on the lat of April.
See Introduction.

11. Fauno decet immolare] The Famis-
lia took on the Ides of December.
But a lesset- festival was observed on the
Ides of February, at the advent of Faunus
(Ρη, the two being, as is well known,
identified by the later Romus. See Diot.
Myth.) See Ο. iii. 18. Ovid, Fast. ii. 193 =
‘⁸ Idibus agrestis sumant altaria Fauni.”
At that time the flocks and herda went out
to gnte, and the god was iuvoked for their
protection- ⁴ Immolare’ admits of two
constructione t with an ablative, as (Livy
xli. 14) “immolantibus J ovi singulisbubus,”
and with au accusative, as (Virg. Aen. x.
519) ‘⁸ inferias quas immolet umbris.”
Horace himself has the latter construction
else-here (S. ii. 3. 1⁶4)= ‘⁴ Immolet aequis

hic porum Laribus? So virgil (Ecl. iii.
77), ‘⁸ radas vitula.” Servius quotes this
run-ge as having the ablative case οἰ the
vicflm. But it appears (according to Orelli,
vbo howeverhas ⁴ agna' and ‘ haedo ') that
in the tables of the batres Arvales the accu-
ntive is used with ‘ immolare) and the abla-
tivo with ‘facere3’ and tha reason is ob-
vimg tho latter is an elliptical expression
ia which ‘mum' is undmtood,as Fea
mar-ks. The MSS. vm. If the accasa-
tive be the nuo reading, aa 1 believe it is,
the ablativo may have got into the MSS.
vannat my remarkable oversight3 ⁴ agnam ⁹
mun bevritten ‘⁸3³5ss and ⁶ haadom' (for
⁸ haedum ') would be written ‘ haedo! These
nnn-ka . were frequently omitted through

think such was the case in this instance.
Ven. has ⁸ agnam ' and ⁴ aedos,’ where it
seems probablethatthe MS. followed by Lan-
dinus had the mark ⁸ a ' in the first word bnt
omitted it in the second, and that the editor
added the ⁸ a ’ to ⁴ haedo ς’ or that this had
been done by the copyist of the MS. he fol-
lowed. Most of the modern editors have
adopted the reading with the ablativo.
Lambinus has the accusative, which is ap-

14. Reqes] This word is commonly ap-
plied to the rich by Horace, and by Terence
too, as Phormio (i. 2. 20): ‘⁴ Oh l regem me
esse oportuit.'’ Sestius was a favourite of
Pol-tune, as a reference to his life will show.
‘¹ Beatus dicitur qni multa habens sine malo
aliquo degit” is Cicero'sdeflnition.

16. premet] From this word which be-
long-s more properly to ‘ nox,’ we must
understand appropriate words ἴοι· ⁸ Manes'
and ⁸ domna? Orelli supplies ⁴ circumvoli-
tabunt' and ⁴ teget!

fabulaeque Manca] Thia is explained by
Juv. S. ii. 1492——

Horace may have had in mind the following
epigram of Callimachus :—

ὦ Χαρῖδα, τί τὰ νόρθες πολῦ σκότος· αἱ δ’
ἄνοδοι τίς

ψεῦδος· ὁ δὲ Πλούτωνς μῦθος· ἀπωλόμεθα.

Persius has imitated Horace, S. v. 152:
‘⁶ cinis et Manes et fabula fles.” ‘ Fabulae’
therefore ‘significa ⁸ unreal! Propert. on
the contrary says (iv. 7. 1), “ Sunt ahquid
Manes: letum non omnia finit! ’—‘ Exilis ' is
variously interpreted, either as ⁴ bare‚' as it
is in Epp. i. 6. 452 ‘⁴ Exilis domus est qua
non et multa supersunt,” or ⁸ shadowy,'
or ‘ narrow‚’ meaning the grave, which is
called ⁸ Leti domus,’ ‘ Ditis aeterna domus’
