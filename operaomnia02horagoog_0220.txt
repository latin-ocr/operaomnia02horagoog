CARMEN XXIII.

Phidyle (from φείδεσθαι) is, according to Juni, ‘⁸ villica haud dubio neu proemitix
in fundo Sabino Horatii ='' to whom Horace wrote this ode, says Dnder, because she com-
plainod that she was not allowed by hot master to offer fine enough sacrifices. Lot us
rather assume that Horace, wishing to embody the principle that any offering to Heaven
is aoneptsble according ω a man's menna (see note on v. 20), put it into the form of an
nadre-s to the plain and piens Phidyle, a person of his own cre-flou, bringing a humble
offen-ing to hor Lares with doubts as to its aooepoenee, or lamenting that she could not

for her poverty offer a worthier snm-ifioe. This explanatIon lies on the surfaoe, and 1 do
not neo any other that the ode is capable of.

ARGUMENT.

My humble Phidyle, lifl: thy hands to heaven, md bring the Lares but incense, fresh corn,
md a sueking-pig, and thoy shall protect thy vines and fields and lambe. Herds tud
ssocks fed on Algidus οι· Alba, these m for the pontifices: do thou bnt oeown thy

gods with ronemary and myrtle, for it is the clean hand and not the oostly sam-ifioe
that coma with aceeptnnoe to the altar.

Nascente Luna, rustica Phidyle,

Si thure placaris et horna
Fruge Lares avidaque porca,
