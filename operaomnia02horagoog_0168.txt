CARMINUM ΙΙΙ. 3. 143

Augustus, and the speech is not destitute of suchoratorical power as the case admitted of.
It also contains indirect exhortatione to abstinenoe and coutentment, and so bem on the
general scope of these odes. Suetonius, in his life of Julius Caesar (c. 79), says it was
generally reported he meant to transfer the seat of empire to Alexandria (in Τιόω pro-
bably, not the Egyptian city) or to Ilium. Luem κατίδοι to him the same intention, and
makes him say (ix. 997),

“ Restituam populos : grata vice moenia reddent
Ausonidae Phrygibus, Romanaque Pergama ειιιᾞοιιίι.υ

Whether such was really the case or not it appears that at the time such a messer was
not considered too absurd tn be spoken of. We know when the abendonment of the
mother city for Veii had its advocates, who were not inssuenced solely by the superior
atti-actions of the city but by dislike to the institutione of Rome, and laws which could
only be got rid of by such a change. We can easily believe thatin Horace’s time among
the remedies proposed for the evils of the state some may have sreely spoken of trans-
ferring the seat of government to another spot, and that the site of (bey, the city of their
ancestors and the fountain of their race, may have been fixed upon for that purpose. To
meet the spirit of avarice in some, and restlessness in all that would be mixed up with such
a uofion, seems to have been Horaoe's purpose. One of Orelli’s Berne MSS. has this
inscription, “ Ad Musas de Augusto qui in proposito videtur perseverare,” as if Augustus
had entertained a desire and intention like the above, and some commentatore have taken
up that notion. If it had been the case there is no likelihood that Horace would have
taken this occasion and means of dissuading him. 1 believe, as 1 mid before, he wrote
these odes, if not by the emperor's desire, to second his efforts and with his approval.

The words in which J nstin describes the meeting of the Roman soldiers with the people
of the Troad, when Scipio lauded in Asia in his expedition against Antiochus, are worth
quoting. He says = “ Cum igitur ab utrisque bellum peraretur ingressique Asiam Romani
nium venissent, mutua gratissatio Iliensium ao Romanorum fuit3 Iliensibus Aeneam
ceterosque cum eo duces a se profectoS, Romanis se ab his procreatos referentibus; tan-
taque laetitia omnium fuit quanta esse post longum tempus inter parentes et liberos solet.
J nvabat Ilienses nepotes suos Occidente et Africa domita Asiam ut avitum regnum vindi-
care, optabilem Trojae ruinam fuisse dicentes, ut tam feliciter renasceretur: contra
Romanos avitos Lares ut incunabula majorum, templaque ae deorum simulam-a inexple-
bile desiderium videndi tenebat ” (31. 8).

ARGUMENT.

The upright man and firm no terrore can drive from his purpose. Through this virtue
Pollux, Hes-cules, Augustus, Bacchus, have been translated to the skies. Romulus

likewise, at the instance of Juno, who thus addressed the assembled gods. “Ilium
