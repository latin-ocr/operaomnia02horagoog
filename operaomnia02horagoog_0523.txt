Quod pingui miscere mero muriaque decebit, 65

made up of the above boiled with chopped raisins at the second course, and likewise

herbs, with a sprinkling of saffron, and,
when it had stood to cool, the finest olive
oil of Venafrum (C. ii. 6. 16, n. .

66. Byzantia patuit orem] The ‘ thyn-
nus' from which the best ⁸ garum! was made
was found best in the neighbourhood of
Byzantium (Pliny ix. 20). ⁴ Orca ' is a jar
used for preserving sauces and ickles.
Suidas derives it from an Aeolio wo ὅρχηι
ὄρχαι, κεράμινα ἀγγεῖα ὑποδεκτικὰ ταρί-
χων. See Bentley's note and Forcell.
Nearly every known MS. has ⁴ putuit!
Lambinus and Torrentius and many of the
old editions have ‘putruit’ (see S. 3. 194‚n.).
The ‘tn-ocus' of Mons Corycus in Cilicia
appears to have been most celebrated (Pliny
xxi. 17). ‘Stetit’ comm. Oruq. explains
‘⁴ cessavit agitare, ferveress'

70. Picenis cedunt pomis Tiburtia] The
apples of Tibur and Picenum have been
{xgr-ed to before (C. i. 7, 143 S. ii. 3.
71. Venucula convenit ollis ,·] This
grape derives its name, comm. Cruq. says,
from Venusia, which is very doubtful. The
word is variously spelt. Pliny says (xiv. 4.
6), ‘⁴ Veniculam inter optime deflorescentes
et ollis aptissimam Campani malunt sir-
culam vocareg alii staculam.” Columella
also (iii. 2. 2, xii. 45) speaks of grapes pre·
sei-ved in jars for the winter. Pliny (xiv. 3)
says ‘⁸ aliis gratiam, qui etvinis, fumus affert
fabrilis? For drying in this way Catius
says the grape of the Alban hills is beot.
His opinion is not supported by any extant
authority, as it is in the other instance.

73. Hanc eqo cum malim] Catius says
he was the first to introduce Albanian

⁴ faex ' and ⁸ allec,’ two pickloe, as it would
seem, but Forcellini makes them the smne,
being the lees of the ‘muria’ (v. 63, n.).
So Pliny describes ‘deest or ‘alex’ asitis
otherwise spelt. Speaking of ‘ganum’ he

ferently applied perhaps. Pliny goes on to
say= ‘⁶ Transiit deinde in luxuriam mve-
runtque genera ad infinitum.— Sic alex pu·-
venit ad osu-eass’ διο. So that it came fmm
being a poor man’s sance to be a rich man's.
Catiusalsoclaims the merit ofintrodum'ng
little dishes containing a mixture of salt and
white pepper. The object of an this, as
well as the pickles‚ was to promote thil-st,
and add to the pleasure of drinking asta·
dinner. ᾞῙιίω pep , as Pliny (xii. 7)
ἷῗῖιῖἒῗὶῃῗῖιξῖ {121⁸qu 'of ltin? bank ⁸251
taking off the rind- The ancients must have
got their pepper from the East Indies. The
best is grown on the Malabet coast.

75. Iucu-etum] This comes from ⁴ in-
cerno,’ to sist, or ⁸ incer-nendo spargoee'
(Porcell.), to scatter with a sieve or ⁴ incer·
niculum.' It therefore means that the pep-
per was sprinkled over the salt. The Scho-
liasta interpret it differently ε Aaou ‘ per-
mixtum,' Porphyrion ‘ non oeetum,' and
Forcellini takes it in the latter way, ‘⁸ in-
divisum, confusum, admixtum—ab incer-no
sed contraria significatione.” ⁴ Catillus ' is
a diminutive form of ⁸ catinus!
