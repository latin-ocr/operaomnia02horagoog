oi the Stoice was essentiali a Roman vir-
tue (seeC..‚S58 n.,)an andylayin action,
and with them the perfectiori of virtue was
the pei-fection of happiness, utility, wealth,
power (see below, v. 106, n.:)‘ ‘Zeno igitur
nullo modo is erat qui ut Theophrastus
nervos virtutis inciderit, sed contra qui
omnia quae ad beatam vitam pertineant in
una virtute poneret, nec quidquam aliud
numeraret in bonis'' (Cic. Ac. Prior. 10).
18. Nunc in Aristippi] After holding
for a time ιο the rigi 'd school of virtue and
the Stoice, he insensibly went over to the
lax doctrines of the C ’,σι whose
founder was Aristippus of Cyrene, one of
Socrates' least worthy disciples. He held
that every man should control circum-
stances and not be contrdled by them.
Hence he did not hesitate to expose himself
ιο the greatest temptations, and once when
he was blamed for keeping company with
Lais, the courtesan, his reply was, ἔχω
Δαιδά ἀλλ’ obsi εομαι (compare Diog.
Inertiv. 66, 68, 75. Aninstanceofhis
indifference iu another way is given above
(8. ii. 3. 100, when he toldhisslavewho was
carrying a of money and was tired, ιο
throw away some of it to lighten his load.
Another story of the same sort is given by
Cicero (de Invent. ii. 58), that he threw his
money into the sea. But his object then

Plutarch sa s he was able ὥσπερ ἐπὶ {hyon

αναφὲρειν καὶ ἀνακουφίζεσθαι αὐτόν (De
Tranq. An. 8), andDiog. (ii. 66), ἣν δὲ

καὶ προσώπῳ, καὶ πᾶσαν περίστασιν
ἁρμονίως ὑποκρίνασθαι. Though there
was much affectnuon and at the same
time a want of practical strietness in
these views, they in theory recognized
sels-control, οι· temperance and contentment,
as the basis of happiness. But while Aris-
tippus inculcated sslf-reliauce and content-
ment, requiring all care for the future ω be

dismissed, and the thoughts and desires ιο
be confined to the present moment, he
brought' ιιι ι1ιο ιιοιίοιι that present pleasurc
was the only happiness, and this doctrine· ιι
associated with the Cyrenaic school. Comm.
Cruq. explains“13t mihi res,’ '.,&c clearly,
saying‚‘ ‘Rebus utor ita ut eis imperem non
autem ιιι eis serviam, ιιι avarus. ” But
Aristippus departed from his own theory
when he departed from the rule of his
teacher and took money from his pu ils.
He was the first of the Soa-stica that di so,
and Xenophon is supposed ιο refer to him,
when he says that some of Socrates' dis·
ciples got for nothing a little of his wisdom
and sold it at a high price to others (Mem.
i02, 5 60). Those that took money from
their disciples Somtes said sold themselves
into slaves-y, and he must therefore have
held this opinion of Aristip us(1b. ξ 6).
Ηίι dialogus with Socratesp in Xen. Mem.
ii. 1) throws light upon his opinions as here
staoed by Horace. The word ‘subjungere’
is plainly taken from putting the neck of
beasts οι· burthen under the yoke.

‘Lenta,' ‘⁴ quo scilicet Horatium ipsum
emendet,” ae Baxter says. The change of
word weakens the force of the verse.

21. ut piyer annus Pupiuis] Every boy
who had lost his father was under a ‘ tutor’
or guardian in respect of his property, while
the care of his person belonged to his
mother, or, in the case of her death, to his
nearest relation, rovided he was not a

‘pup illus' himse. This lasted till the
age of puberty (fourteen). The boy was a

‘pupillusss not in relation ιο his mother,
but ιο his tutor, who might be appointed
by the mother i'f she had by thep father’s
will tutor-iso tionem: and if that‘ optio’
was‘ plena’ s e might change the tutor as
oftenpasshe p·leased ifitwas ‘'angusta,
the number of times she was allowed to
change was limited by the will. In the
former case her guardianship might be

‘'dura, oppressiva and mischievous, as of
course it might be in many other ways it
she were an unnatural mother, but Horace
means that it was irksome to boys, because
they wished to be their own masters.
