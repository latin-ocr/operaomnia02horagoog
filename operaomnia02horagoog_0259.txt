HORATII FLAGOI

Ille, mordaci velut icta ferro
Pinus aut impulsa cupressus Euro, ιο
Procidit late posuitque collum in
Pulvere Teucro·
Ille non inclusus equo Minervae
Sacra mentito male feriatos
Troas et laetam Priami choreis 15
F alleret aulam ς
Sed palam captis gravis, heu nefas heu,
Nescios fari pueros Achivis
Ureret flammis, etiam latentem
Matris in alm, 20
N i tuis victus Venerisque gratae
Vocibus divom pater annuisset
Rebus Aeneae potiore ductos
Alite muros·

Patribus orti,

17. captis] From the variation of the
oldest MSS. in this word it has been gene-
rally given up es a genuine reading, while,
in the absence of a better word, it has been
usually received into the text. Ἰ do not
think it would be profitable to repeat all
that has been said on the subject, and have
no means of suggesting a better reading.
It must be understood therefore that none
of the editors defend ⁸ captis' as if it were
the word Horace wrote, and that it is only
adopted for want of a better. A similar in·
stance, in which the oldest known MSS. are
supposed to be at fault, is found in Epp. ii.
2. 199. The Scholiasta give us no help in
the matter. ‘ Victis' and ‘victor ' areamong
the various readings of the old and good
MSS. for ⁴ ceptis ς’ and, as these cannot be
mere errors of transcription, it may be as-
sumed that the real word is lost. For this
reason the word ⁶ captis ⁹ is usually printed
in a different type from the rest.

21. Νι· tuit victus] ⁸ Fletus, ' which
Bentley adopts on little euthoiity for ⁴ vie-
tus,’ is an evident gloss.

23. ductet] Aen. i. 4232 ‘⁴ Pars ducere
muros. ’⁹ The Greeks would say τρίχους
ἐλαύνειν. To follow all the nenses to which
this word ‘ ducere' is' applied, and to tram
them to their mdical sense, is not easy.
These who wish to attempt the task will
find ample metm-inlu in the example· given
in Foroellini's Lexioon.

25. Doctor aryutae] Some MSS. have
⁶ ductor' (corresponding to μουσηγέτης),
others ⁸ Argivae,’ some both ⁴ ductor ’ and
⁶ Argivae) Bentley thinks ⁶ Argivae ’ the
best reading(as “ Graiae Camenae,” C.ii. 16.
38), supposing Horace meant to oppone the
Greek to the Roman muse, but he does not
sufficiently trust his own arguments to ad-
mit that word into the text. Jani says
‘Argivae' is “haud dubie unice vera leo-
tio.'’ 1 have no doubt ⁸ argutae ⁹ is right.
The river Xanthus here mentioned was in
Lycia.

27. Dauniae] See C. iii. 3⁰. 10, n.
The Greeks gave this name (ἁγυιεύς) to
Apollo as worshipped in and provectius the
meets of citios.
