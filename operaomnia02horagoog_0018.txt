INTRODUGTION. xvii

storm in which he was nearly lost off Cape Palinurus ², on the western
coast of Italy. When this happened nobody knows. After the publica-
tion of the three books of Odes, Horace seems to have ceased from that
style of writing, or nearly so; and the only other compositione we know
of his having produced in the next few years are metrical Epistles to
different friends, of which he published a volume probably in A.u.0. 734
or '7 35. He seems to have taken up the study of the Greek philoso-
phical writerS, and to have got a good deal intel-ested in them, and also
to have become a little tired of the world and dis-guted with the
jealousies his reputation created. His health did not impr-ove as he got
older, and he put himself under the care of Antonius Musa, the em-
peror's new physician ³. By his advice he gave up, for a time at least,
his favourite Baiae. But he found it necessary to be a good deal away
from Rome, especially in the autumn and winter ⁴.

· In mmo. 73'7 Augustus celebrated the Ludi Seculares, and Horace
was required to write an Ode for the occasion, which he did, and it has
been preserved. This circumstance, and the creditit brought him, may
have given his mind another leaning to Ode-writing, and have helped
him to produce the fourth book, a few pieces in which may have been
written at any time. It is said that Augustus particularly desired
Horace to publish another book of Odes, in order that those he wrote*
upon 'the victories of Drusus and Tiberius (4 and 14) might appear in
it. The latter of these Odes was not written, I believe, till Απο. 741,
when Augustus returned 'from Gaul. If so, the book was probably
published in that year, when Horace was fifty-two. The Odes of the
fourth book show no diminution of power, but the reverse. There are
none in the three first books that surpass or perhaps equal the Ode
in honour of DrusuS, and few superior to that which is addressed to
Lollius. The success of the three first books, and the honour of being
chosen to compose the Ode at the Ludi seculares, seem to have given
him encouragement. There are no incidente in his life during the above
period recorded or alluded to in his poems. He lived five years after
the publication of the fourth book of Odes, if the above date be correct,
and during that time Ι think it probable he wrote the Epistles to Au·
gustus and Florus which form the second book ; and having conceived
the intention of writing a poem on the art and progress of poetry, he
wrote as much of it as appears in the Epistle to the Pisones which has
been preserved among his works. The fragments of which that poem
appears to be composed, and which some have vainly tried to reduce to
a consistent whole, may have been written earlier than Ι have supposed3
