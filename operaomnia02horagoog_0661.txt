EPISTLE XVIII.

Heu-eve have some more advice to a young man beginning meanto how he thouldwin
the favour of the great. The person adds-eumd is young Lollius, κυματίης whom see the
Introduction to Epp. 2 of thie book, which in also addreseed to him. Though n distine-
fion is drawn between vulgar fluttery und refined, and the first is condemned, which in this
ease eould scarcely be necessary, it would be hard to imagine nuy thing more ἆορ-Δίας tn
a fine und independent mind then the urta by which this young mun ie taughtto rise-
It seems ne if Horace thought there wne danger of his being foolish enough tn prefer his
books or his reoeentlone or inteueotunl privucy to the boisterous testes or varying humum
of ι potrum—a folly of which he must by no menne be guilty. He m of an ingenuo-s
dispositionifthere is nnymetningin the firstverse3 but hem to school hisumgm
andhismunners to ι refluedeervility. und to consider thie oet uvir-tue. Thnt Hom
wne himself tired of the life he recommends, we may infer from the cloeing venes. It
would have been more munly if he had held up his expet-laneo in the way of turning to
the young mu thet he thould avoid these dmgeroue und ditty water-n. But Honoe’s

peroeive but not prompt to not.

The date ie generally assumed to be Α.υ.ο. 734, the yen- in which the stando-ds m
restored by the Parthiam. Thiedepends partly on the uocumyof them-diminuat

ARGUMENT.

Unlees 1 nm mistnken in you, my frank Lollius, you tre not the person to act flu
punite under the μή) of a friend. There is ns much differ-enee between the tvo ιε
betvmeu a chuta marmanda hurlot. But even a greater fnnlt than this is nn uffen-
n’on of roughnesa which mus ituelf liberty aud virtue. Renl virtue is n menn batum
opposite vices. You shall see one et the rich man’e tnble mmbliug ot his every look,
oetaehing up and echoing hin words like a school-bey or second-part seton while nuotbe
brawls for trinos ae one who would not give up n point or heve hin bnwling mpped,
no, not if you'd give him his life over nguin-

(ν. 21.) Greut people have a horror of the mnu of plausum, the gambles, the eoreomb·
the eovetoun, though they may be ten timeo worse themselvee3 or the patron, if he
sees one aping him, will. if ho be kind, admoniuh him, eaying, ‘⁴ 1 eun affor-d to be ι
little foolinh: you oennot.” Eutrapelus, if he had ι spite against any one, would give
him some fine clothesg for he knew they would change the mau's character entirely.
that he would turn idle, profligate, flpendthril't, und come to object poverty in the end-

(v. 87.) You must never be inquisitive about your patron'e sem-ets, or betny them; nor
pruine your testes at the expense of hin nor take to your books when he vente to go out
hunting. On such grounds the brothers Amphion and Zethus qum-ello& and ns the
one yielded to the other, no do you yield to your putron's kind eommnndnz put any
your books und go with him to the ohne, and like him earn your dinner by your wil,
aa the old Romans did, especially now you are young aud swifl: and strong, admind in
the Campus, and experieueed in war under our great commander. Beeidee you have
no excuse, for you know what manly sporta are, you who heve pnetined eham fighb nt
your father's place in the country. He who thlnltu your tante necorde with his, vin
pruine your ammonente to the ekies.
