Karthagini jam non ego nuntios
Mittam superbos : occidit, occidit
Spes omnis et fortuna nostri
Nominis Hasdrubale interempto.
Nil Claudiae non perficient manus,
Quas et benigno numine J uppiter
Defendit et curae sagaces
Expediunt per acuta belli.

only a repetition of Hannibal’s complaint.
73. perficient] There seems to be more
authority for the future tense thau the
present which Bentley adopts, and as a
prophecy in the mouth of an enemy it has
perhaps more weight, and it is more in ac-
cordance with the preceding consti-actions.

A.U.C. 740.

This ode was written afl’er the German victories celebrated in thelast ode and C. 1⁴. and
perhaps sent to Augustus in Gaul A.u.c. 740. What were the reasons for the Emperor's
protractcd absence we cannot tell, but we need not on that account give aedit to the con-
jectures mentioned before (C. iv. 2, Introduction). It was perhaps the polioy of Augustus
to make his absence felt, and we may believe that the langnage of Horace, which bears
much more the impression of real feeling than of ssattery‚ represented the sentimenta of
great numbers at Rome, who felt the want of that presiding genius which had brought
the city through its long troubles and given it comparative peace. There could not be a
more comprehensive picture of security and rest obtained through the influence of one
mind. than is represented in this ode, ir we except that with which no nna-ely morta! lan·
gnage can compare (lsaiah xi. and lxv. Micah iv.). The Carmen Saeculare contains
much that is repeated here. Virgil’s description in his fourth Eclogue will naturally
occur to the reader.

ARGUMENT.

Τοο long hant th'on lest us, onr guardiam fulfil thy promise and return as the spring to
gladdeu our hearts. As the mother sor her absent son, so does Rome sigh for her
Caesar. Onr fields are at peace, the very sea is at rest, our morals are pure, our women
are chaste, the law is strong, our enemies are silenced, each man lives in quiet and
blesses thy name as Greece that of Castor or Hercules. Long mayst thou be spared
to bless ns, is our prayer both morning and evcning.
