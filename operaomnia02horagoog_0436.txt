SATIRARUM I. 8. 411

SATIRE VIII.

On the outside of the city walls, in fient of Mons Esquilinus, hythe Campus Esqui-
linus, in which was a public buriul-ground for the pooreet of the people, eud the Sestertium
or place of execution for slaves end others of the lower sort, whose bodies were lest un-
buried for the doge end vultures to prey upon (see Epod. v. 100). This place, which
must always heve been e public nuisance and a source of melaria, was given (es some say)
by a deoeee of the senate to Maecenas, or else purchased by him, cleared, druined‚ end
laid out in gardens, in which he ester-warde built e handsome house (eee C. iii. 29. Epod.
ix. , xiv. Introduction. S. ii. 3. 309). His example was afterwards followed by a member
of the house of lamia, in whose gardens Caligula was buried (Suet. Calig. e. 59). The
following Saum was suggested by e figure of Priapus eet up in Meecenns' garden. The
god is represented ae conti-nsting the preeent state os the ground with what it once was,
by which a eompliment ie eonveyed ιο Maecenas for his public spirit in ridding the city of
such a nuisunce. Priapus ie also made to complain of the trouble he hee in keeping the
ground clear of uespeseers, but more particularly of the witchee, who, having formerly
carried on their practices' among the tombs end bones of the dead, continued to haunt
the scene of their iniquity. This ie introduced for the purpose of dragging in the woman
whom Horace satirized under the neme of Gratidio.. The description ie in come parts
very like that of the fifth Epode, and the tw0 may heve beenwritten about the seme time.
It is not very likely Horace would heve maintained hie wei-fere with this woman, whoever
she was or whatever her offence, for several years. Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 16), beeeuee
in S. ii. 3. 312 reference ie mede to Maecenas ee engaged in buiffling, places these two
Satires in consecutive years, this being written A.t1.c. 721 (see Introduction to Epod. v.).
But there is not much in thie argument. The cleering, dreining, end enclosing of the
ground must heve taken some time, end it may have been several years before it wne fit
for living on, end no reference is mede to a house in thie Setire. Frenke placauit in
A.u.c. 718. There ie very little clue to the date.
