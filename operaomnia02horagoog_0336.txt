EPODON LIBER, 16. :311

CARMEN XVI.

Thin ode is written with great cure, and was probnbly ono of those compositione by
which Horace brought himself into public notice. It hus more the appearance of having
been written sor fune then any other in the book. 1 heve no doubt it m written eoon
nster Horace cume ιο Rome αι the outbreek of the Pei-usian war, mmc- 713. Some
follow what they suppone to be the meaning of the Scholiast Acron, who says on the
word ‘Altera’ (v. 1): “quando Antonius dimicavit contu-⁸ Augustum? But ho may
have referred to L. Antonius the conuulg et any ηιο the langunge md sentimenta are eo
different from any that Horace used or m likely ιο uec about the time of Actium, that
the odo cannot be referred ιο that period. The etate os Rome et the tzime cupposed in

been supposed that the notion of mig-roting ιο the fortunate islanda, which many of the
commentatore have taken ιοο lites-nlly, was derived from tho words of Sertorius, recorded
by Plutarch in his life (c. viii.), and nid by the Scholioet Acron ιο hove been mentioned
by Sallust. (If this remark be true, it seems to ehow that Sellust’s Histoi-y included

he wne hurd pushed by Lucem the legate of Sulla, Sertorius, falling in with some nilon
who had visited or been driven ιο the Weeoern Islnndo, end hearing from them o glowing

of the eume (Op. οι Di. 167) ι τοῖς δὲ δίχ’ ἀνθρώπων βίοτον καὶ ἤθε’ ὀπάσσας, cml„

ARGUMENT.

Another age is wanting in civil wera. She whom no enemy could tame shall be desnoyed
by her own accursed children ς tho wild beust shall devour her3 the barbarian ehull
tromple upon her, und ocetter the duct of her Romulus ιο the winda. What are we ιο
do? Go forth like the Phocoeune, leuve our homes and our temples ιο be the donn of
betete, and go wherever the winda shall wast us. shall it be eo? 'rhen why delay?
But let us eweur z—when rocks shall swina, und the Po ehull wesh the ιορε of Matium,
und the Apennino be met into the ωας when the tiger shall lie with the bimi, und the
dove with the hawk, and the herde seur not the lion, and the lte-gont shall love tho
wem—then we will return ιο our home. Thu· let the nobler spirits resolve while the
craven clinga to hie conch. For us there are those happy icles where the earth yielde her
hai-veste ond the trees their fruit unbidden3 where honey drope from the σοὶ, und the
stream leupo bebbling from the hill„ where the goat comes unbidden ιο the milk-pail,
und uddera are full, md the fold seete no beusts, and the ground beers no viper3 where
tho rain-flood und the ‹lx-ought ure not known 3 whither the venturoun nil comcs not3
where the θοοὶ is unhul-t by pestilence or beet. Jove destined these shores for the
pion· when the golden age had passed away, and thither the picus may reeort ond

prosper.
