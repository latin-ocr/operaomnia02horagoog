Pane egeo jam mellitis potiore placentis.
Vivere naturae si convenienter oportet
Ponendaeque domo quaerenda eet area primum,
Novistine locum potiorem rure beato?

Est ubi plus tepeant hiemes, ubi gratior aura

Cum semel accepit Solem furibundus acutum?
Est ubi divellat somnos minus invida cura?

“ quid recen-at intre Naturae fines viventi.”
Diogenes Inert- (vii. 87) σαμε πρῦτσς ὁ
Ζὴνων-τέλος εἶπε τὸ ὁμολογουμένως τῇ
φύσει ζῆν. This was the fundamental
doctrine of Stoic morality, but the teachers
of that school differed as to the word ⁴ ns-
ture,’ which indeed it is not easy to define.
Aa e, mere socinl question, which is the
only point of view Horace is concerned
with, the artificial state of society and mode
of life in lnge towns he considerans all
must, to be a vvider de from the
normal condition, which may be called
natural, than ι conum-y life.

13. Ponendaeque domo] There are three
forms of this dative, ⁴ domui,' ‘domo,’ ‘ domi!
‘Area' is uny open space, here for building
on. The technical meaning of it is given

19. Deterim Libycis olet] Horace aske
whether the field covered with nowers
emells less meet and looks less benutifiss
than marble floooes laid with mosaic pictores
ond strewed with flowers or other pei-fumes.
Respecting the Libyen end other marbles
neec. ii. 18. 3, n. By ‘lapillis' Horace
means the small pieces of different mai-bles
with which the floors were laid, ⁴ tessellae ⁹
or ⁴ metulae’ as they were called. Augus-
tine (de Ordine i. 2) uses the illustretion
of ο, mosaic to show the folly of those who ·
look only to small parts of the divine dis-
pensatione rather than to the whole, md
uses Horuce's word ‘lapilliz’ “Sed hoc
pecto, si quis tam minutum cernent, ut in
vermiculato pavimento nihil ultro unius
tessellae modulum acies ejus valeret ambire,
vituperant artificem velut ordinationis et
compositionis ignarum, eo quod varietatem
lapillorum perturbatam putaret, a quo illa
emblemata. in unius pulchritudinis faciem
congruentia simul cerni collustrarique non -
possent.” Such pavements, which are now
so costly as only to be found in the richest
houses, were formerly very common in
Italy. They were wrought in coloured
mai-bles, or the more ordinary ones in white
and black. Pliny (l. xxxvi. c. 64) says that
these ‘pavimenta’ (λιθόστρωτα) were first
introduced by Sulla, who had one made for
the temple of For-tune at Pmeneste. He also
gives directions for laying the substratum
of such θοοὶ-3, and they hove been found to
cor-respond with some foundations that have
been discovered, particularly in the Roman
villa st Northleigh in Oxfonlshire. The
foundation was laid seven feet deep, end
consisted of different leyers of rubble, ashes,

broken pote, δια, at the top being a luyer
