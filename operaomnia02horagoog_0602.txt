EPISTOLARUM Ι. 6. 577

(v. 65.) But if life is nothing without love and jem, then in love and j'ests let us live.

And so good bye. If yon know any better rules, be good enough to let me know them
too. 1f not, let us both follow mine together.

N IL admirari prope res est una, Numici,

Solaque quae possit facere et servare beatum.

Hunc solem et stellas et decedentia certis

Tempora momentis sunt qui formidine nulla

Imbuti spectent: quid censes munera terrae, 5
Quid maris extremos Arabas ditantis et Indos,

Ludicra quid, plausus et amici dona Quiritis,

Quo spectanda modo, quo sensu credis et ore!

Qui timet his adversa fere miratur eodem

Quo cupiens pact03 pavor est utrobique molestus ιο
Improvisa simul species exterret utrumque.

Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuatne‚ quid ad rem,

Si quidquid vidit melius pejusve sua spe

l. Nil admirari] The equability of the
seul, καθ’ ἢν γαληνῶς καὶ εὐσταθῶς ἠ
ψυχὴ διάγει ὑπὸ μηδένας repara-optut,
φόβου ἦ δεισιδαιμονίας ἣ ἄλλοι· τινὸς

· πάθους (Diog. Inert- ix. 45), was one of

the fundamental doctrines of Democritus
of Abdera, and he called it by various
names, as εὖέστω, ἀταραξία, ἁρμονία, συμ-
fflssfi‘iigz‘fiffflfffflzs⁶33·„3:‘„¹2⁶.{3;⁰

and Heraclitus before either of them, and
the same doctrine was held in one form or
other by nearly every school of Greek phi-
losophy as the foundation of mox-als and of
happiness. In the theory of the sensual
Aristippus it was an essential part (see
Epp. i. l. 18, n.). Epicurus and Zeno
equally found it necessary to their views
of the chief good, as we find from the
ma. 3325.. ssfissffiffmssi‘zssiffiz
from the nature of their several systema.
It is this sels-control that Horace says is
the only means of making a man happy
and keeping him so. ⁴ Nil admirari' can
only be said to be necessary to this rule
when admiration amounts to a stupid won-
der, excessive sear, excitement, or other
effects by which the judgment is misled and
the passione roused injuriously. Horace
had too much sense to recommend a stupid
spathy, or that affectation of sslf-possession
which is not uncommon, and is the height
of coxcombry. As to ‘prope' see S. ii. 3.
32, n. .

4. sunt quisomidt‘ne naua] ⁸ Formido ⁹
is here equivalent to δεισιδαιμονία, a mper-
stitious dread of the influences of the hea-
venly bodies which acts upon vulgar miuds.
The best MSS.. and most of them, have
⁸ spectent! A few quoted by Fea (who
adopts the indicative) have ⁶ spectant: which
some other editors prefer. 1 think Horace
is referring generally to men of philosophical
mind rather than to any particular sect or
individuale, aud therefore that the subj unc-
tive is wanted. (See C. i. l. 3, n.)

6. Arabas ditantis et Iudam]
C. iii. 24. l t

‘⁶ Intactis opulentior
Thessuris Arabum et divitis Indise.”

The treasures of the sea brought stom the
East were chiefly pearls and coi-al.

7. Ludit-ra quid, plausus] This refers
perhaps to the exhibition of gladiatorial
and other shows, by which the favour of the
people and such rewards as they could
bestow were sought. As to the singular
⁴ Quiritis ⁹ see C. ii. 7. 3.

9. sere] This is used much as ‘prope'
is above. Horace says that fesr and desire
are much on a par, both indicating the
want of that equanimity which he com-
mends at starting. ⁴ Miratur’ expresses
the astonishment of sear as well as of ad-
miration, and so does ‘ stupet ⁹ frequently,
and ⁴ exterret’ applies like ἐκπλήσσειν to
either state of mind. ‘Torpet' does the
same. (See S. ii. 7. 95.)
