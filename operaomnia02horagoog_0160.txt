CARMINUM ΙΙ. 20.

Me Colchus et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis Dacus et ultimi
N oscent Geloni, me peritus

Discet Hiber Rhodanique potor.

Absint inani funere neniae
Luctusque turpes et querimoniam
Compesce clamorem ac sepulcri
Mitte supervacuos honores.

And, though Perseus went there, it was with
the divine help, with which the poet piously
observes sny thing may be done. They did
not however neglect the Muses ε·-

Tlmy were s happy rece, ἀνδρῶν μακάρων

from old age, dimne, sud war. Compare
Pliny (N . H. iv. 26). These consideratione
will exphin Horaee's meaning.

19. peritus] Here the meaning is ‘in-
anactea: as ‘juris peritus’ is one insu-acted
and skilled in the law. Horace means that

barbanus ustions will become vel-sed in
his writings: ‘meiperitusmediscet'is per-
haps the run sentence. But why he should
class those who drmk of the waters of the
Rhone (of which many Romans dnnk) with
the barbaricus mentioned is not easy to
understand. As fu· ss Ι cen see, the ada -
tntion of the name to the mette is the o y
way of accounting for it. By Hiber is pro-

243 Supervacua] The prose-writers
before Pliny used the form ‘ supervacaneus!
Forcellini quotes one passage from Cicero
(de Nat. Deor. i. 33), in which he says some
editions have ⁸ supervacuus! All modern
editions hsve the other form.
