Cum tua pervideas oculis mala lippus inunctis,

HORATII FLAOOI

Gur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum

Quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius? At tibi contra
Evenit, inquirant vitia ut tua rursus et illi.

Iracundior est paulo, minus aptus acutis

Naribus horum hominum; rideri possit eo quod

Rusticius tonso toga defluit et male laxus
In pede calceus haeret: at est bonus ut melior vir
Non alius quisquam, at tibi amicus, at ingenium ingens

Inculto latet hoc sub corpore.

Concute num qua tibi vitiorum inseverit olim

on the authority of one MS„ to ⁴ praevideas,’
which Rutgersius had conjectured without
knowing there was this authority. He
quotes a MS. ot* Acron as having ‘provi-
deas,’ which Fea found in two vatican MSS.
The received text of the Scholiasta give
⁴ pervideas! The sense in which ‘praevi-
deas’ is understood is that of ⁴ praetervidere:
agennenses& iam
quoted from Plutarch:

τί τάλλότριον, ὦνθρωπε βασκανώτατε,
κακὸν ὀξυδερκεῖς, τὸ δ’ ἴδιον παραβλέπειςς

But there is no authority for that use of the
word ⁴ praevidere! The reading ot* nearly
all the MSS. and editions, ⁴ pervideas ’ gives
the best sense, ⁴ while you see through your
own saults as well as a blear-eyed man might
do.' Bentley would like to read ⁴ cum tua
tu videas,'—a very unfortunate suggestion.
He also changes ⁴ mala’ into ‘male,’ upon
little authority, and that construction occurs
often enough in this Satire: we do not need
to add another example. The MSS. and
editions are nearly unanimous in reading
⁴ mala! Fea mentions ⁴ pervideas mala’ as
the reading ot* Hildebert at ihs end of the
eleventh century. (Mor. Phil. Oper. 996.)

27. serpeus Epidaurius f] The serpente
of Epidaurus (on the Sinus Saronicus) were
proverbial, in consequence of Aesculapius
having been conveyed from that place,
where above others he was worshipped, to
Rome, in the form of a serpent, to avert a
pestileuce. (See Liv. Epit. lib. xi.)

29. Iracundior est partlm] Horace is
illustrating here the tendency ot* those
quiebsighted critice of their neighbours’
characters to maguify the faults they find.
Tho first instance is of a man who is sensi-
tive under (not suited for) the sharp judg-
ment of the men of that day (⁴ horum

Denique te ipsum

hominum ⁹), men who had the keenness of
a bloodhound’s scantin finding out defecta,
and no delicacy iu proclaiming them. So
Ι understand 4 minus aptus,' διε. with the
Scholiasta. Orelli interprets it differently:
that the man, by being somewhat hasty,
gave a handle ιο these Pharisees. In respect
to the next instance of a person ot* slovenly
habits, Acron says ⁴⁴ hic dieitur pulsare Vir-
gilium qui indecori corporis et habitus fuit.”
He had no doubt met with that statement,
which is repeated by Cruquius’ Scholiast,
but how much reliance is ιο be placed upon
it cannot easily be determined. Weishert
22⁹?f2‘34fflssiiffgssfflffinssffiffffi
fluit’ is absolute, ‘hange down.’ 4 Male’
belongs to ‘laxus.’ (See v. ⁴5. and C. i.
17. 25, n.). To be slipshod (μείζω τοῦ
ποδὸς ὑποδήματα φορεῖν, Theophr. Char.
4) has always been the proverbial charac-
teristic of a sloven. 44 Nec s in laxa
pes tibi pelle natet ” (Ovid, A. A. i. 516).
‘At’ is repeated in the same way as here
by Cicero, in his eighth letter to Caelius
(Ad Fam. ii. 15): ‘⁸ Puerum, inquies? At
quaestorem, at nobilem adolescentem, at
omnium fere exemplo.” In Verr. ii. 5. 1:
44 at est bonus imperator, at felix ;” ii. 3.
4: 44 at sermone, at literis, at humanitate
ejus delectamini.’'

34. Ιιοο sub corpora] The reading of
Lambinus, Torrentius, and others supported
by a few respectable MSS. ⁴ pectore: is

justly condemned by Bentley.

35. Consum] The metaphorisprobably
derived from the shaking os a cloak, or any
thing of that sort, ιο see if there is any thing
hid in it. Orelli calls this ‘⁴ imaginem
desumptam ab eo qui furem concutit,” that
is, it means ‘to search,' as suspected per·
sons are searched by the police. ‘Excutio’
is used in that connexion in Plautus (Aulnl.
