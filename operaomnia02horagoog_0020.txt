The same remark applies in some measure to other Odes addressed

I have expressed my opinion of Horace as a 8811110111 writer in various
places. On this point the reader may refer to the remarks in the
Introduction to the ninth Satire of the first book. of common 80080

ture and good breeding, Horace has shown sufficient proofs, both' 111
the Satires and the Epistles. As a critic 110 15 certainly defective.
Homer he does not appear to have understood. Plautus and Terence
110 could not appreciate, and the 1001118 of Lucilius (and he must have
had merita) would probably never have been acknowledged or discovered
by Horace but for the feeling his criticism of that writer raised against
himself. He was of 80 101101001 habit, of which the unfinished state of 801110
of 1118 pocms is 000 of the effects. ‘'‘ Amphora coepit Institui; currente

more than 000 of his Satires and Epistles. There is more inequality 10
111050 than in the 01108 ; 10010 also that is common-place in thought and
diction. The Odes will bear bet-ter than the Satires and Epistles the
close inspection that an editor 18 obliged to give them. Any one who
undertakes that office for Horace will find that one of his principal
difficulties consists 10 1110 examination, first separately and then collec-
tively, of 80 many small pictures as the 01108 present. The tendency of
commentatore to far- fetched conjectures as to 111011 scope, allusione,
date, &c., is very great, and the above difficulty partly accounts for it.
Their beauties and merits appear to me to be of a quiet kind, and
the happy selection of words 18 one of them. Horace' s selection of
epitheta is judicious and sorcible. “Mirus ac paene divinus Horatius
est in epithetis inveniendis ⁶.’' The terseness and good sense of the
sayings which concern human life and character are as striking as
the manner in which they 810 introduced, being always in their place
and never brought in clumsily, 88 811011 sentences with less art might
easily appear. Hei-ein, more than in any other respect, Horace suc-
