CARMEN XX.

This ode hee none of the appearance to my mind of having been written, like the het
of the third book, for the purpose of cloeing end commending a completed work, ne thoee
affirm who believe the two first books were published eepnrately. Tbere doee not appear
to be any method in the arrangement of the odee between the inc-oductory one of the
first book and the leet of the third (with the exception ofthe six first ofthatbook which
nre evidently connected with one another) ς und the position of this ie probebly ee occidental
ne that of othere. This ode appears to heve been written impromptu, and 1 think the style
ie mcclx-heroic, or but half anione, though Horace hed at least ns much right ne othere to
commend his poeti-y end to be conecious of hie own powers. Vni-ioue specimene of eels-
commendation, on the pert of the poete, ere quoted by Dillenb. on C. iii. 30, beginning
with Ennius’ famous venes,—

“ Nemo me lacrumis decoret nee funere fletu
Fuit. Cur? Volito vivu' per ore. viriiml'
1 think ⁸ quem vocee’ refers to some particular invitation of Maecenas, and that the ode
wne the result of thet invitation, which opinion 1 had expreseed before Ι met with Dil-
lenbr.'e commento on thie ode in his Qu. Hor. (1841, Bonn). He there treet· it ee an
outbnret of youthful spirite on the occasion of Maecenne' first invitation, deeoeibed in Set.
i. 6. The epithet ‘dilecte’ implyingnfemilinrity of nome standing, ie oppoeedto this
view, end Dillenbr. enyo nothing about it in hie edition of Horace, though he there tmen
the ode aa n juvenile productiori. 1 do not eee any reeeon to agree with him es to that
puticulnr point.
ARGUMENT.

On a fresh strong wing shall 1 soe-r to heaven far above envy end the world. Whom
thou, deur Maecenas, delighteet to honour, Styx bath no power to detein. Even now
my plnmege ie epn‘nging, end 1 em ready to fly away and sing in dietant placeo, end to
teeeh berb-mne notione. No weilinge for me ε away with the empty honours of a tomb.
