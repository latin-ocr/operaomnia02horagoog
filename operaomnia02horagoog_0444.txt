‘SATIRARUM 1. 9.

419

Circumagi; quendam volo visere non tibi notum;
Trans Tiberim longe cubat is prope Caesaris hortos?
‘⁶ Nil habeo quod agam et non sum piger3 usque sequar te.''

Demitto auriculas ut iniquae mentis asellus,
Cum gravius dorso subiit onus.

Incipit ille ε 2⁰

“ Si bene me novi non Viscum pluris amicum,
Non Varium facies3 uam quis me scribere plures

18. stane whereas—cubat ie] ⁸ Cubat ’
is generally taken ιο mean that his friend is
lying sick, and 1 am inclined ιο think it can
have no other meaning here. In other
places where it occurs it might be supposed
{aserim this signification from the context.

Sat. ii. 3. 289 :—

“ Mater ‘ait pueri menses jam quinque cu-
Fnbgindtaassi puerum quartana reliquerit ;'’

and Bpp. (ii. 2. 68) :—

“ — cubat hic in colle Quirini
1110 effreno in Aventino, visendus uter-
que.

rhum (eas. Prot 37) :—

“—- servus qui in morbo cubat:
Immo hercle vero in lecto ne qui mentiar δ”

and other places usually quoted for this
meaning. But 1 see no other sense ιο give
the word here that is supported b usage
(⁴⁸ He lives above a mile of ground beyond
the Tiber,” which is Francis’s translation,
is an unexampled meaning to give the word,
but many have adopted it) ς and moreover
it is likely Horace would invent this excuse
by way of shnking off his companion. In
cic. Verr. (ii. 3. 23, where, see Mr. Long’s
note), ⁴ cubaret ’ means no more than that
the man was in bed. Julius Caesar had
some pleneme-grounds, which he bequeathed
ιο the Roman people‚ on the right bank of
the Tiber, near (says Turnebus) ιο the
Porta Portuensis, that is, not far from the
Pons Sublicius. This would be a long way
from the Sacra Via.

22. non Viscum pluris amicum] In the
next satire we have (v. 83) “ Fuscus et
haec utinam Viscorum laudet uterque ;''
and at the supper of Nasidienus (ii. 8. 20)
we hsve ‘⁶ Summus ego et prope me Viscus
Thurinus, et infra Si memini Varius.” On
the present passage Acron and Comm.
Cruq. say that Viscus was “ disertus
illius temporis homo,” and some said he
was a poet, and a friend of Horace's.

Porphyrion has here the name ⁶ Fuscum ’
(or, as it appears in Ascensius' text twice
over, ⁴ Tuscum’), and says he was a distin-
guished writer of 'es. Here he is
associated with Varius, and in the latter of
the above a Viscus also appears in
Varius' company. In the former there are
two Visci and a Fuscus, and Varius just
above. All this creates some doubt as ιο
the reading here. Aristius Fuscus was one
of Horace's most intimate friends (C. i. 22,
Introduction), and we meet with him below
.(v. 61) in a very humorous character. lt
Vis& ¹:111)a b: meant ὴῗτοῒῗοι· he 31ιὲῗηίῗῶ
them both among his best friends (io. 83).
As ιο Varius, see above on S. 6. 40.

23. quie me scribere plures Aut citius]
The ignorant follow here fastens upon the
very faculty that Horace held in the greatest
235³?ss ’.ζ Ἣ-’ἓὲο ὼηξῖἶῗῗῗῖἒ
terrupting the prater whffio Horace seized
upon is not very apparent. Orelli and others
say because he was determinet! not to listen
ιο the praises of Hermogenes, whom he
detessed. 1 amnotsurethatwearenotto
understand that the man gives a spedmen
of his voice as he gives out the words ⁸ ego
canto! But however this may be, Horace
gets in a word, end, trying ιο resign himself
ιο his fate, and ιο turn the conversation to
topice too unmeaning ιο give a handle ιο
the man’s vanity, he aske him if his father
ond motherarc alive: ‘quis ιο salvo eet
opus ' is only a formula of civility. The
man who has no feeling for any one but
himself, answers with indifferenoe that he
has buried them ull, which gives ooeasion
for Horace ιο exclaim interually, he wishes
he was dead‘too. What follows 1 suppose
we must understand εἴ s quaint notion
