32 HORA'I'II FLAOOI

CARMEN XII. ,
ΛΑΜ). 725—729.

Marcellus married Julia, the daughter of Augustus, sanc. ¹729, and died 731. The
allusion in v. 45 of this ode makes it quite certain that it was written before the death of
Marcellus, and aster he had attained an age in which he could give promise of sustaining
the distinction of his name. The meaning of that stanza is plainly this: ‘⁶ The fame of
the house of Marcellus, taking its birth from the great Claudius the victor of Syracuse,
is growing up through successive generations like the insensible growth of a tree, and
promises to come to maturity in Octavia’s son.” Franks thinks the ode was written
before Augustus went against the Cantabrians in 729, and about the time of Marcellus’
marriage, when he was only in his eighteenth year. Others place it aster Augustus'
return from Spain in A.u.c. 730, and the closing of the temple of Janus. 1 think with
Franke some allusion ιο this event would have been made had the ode been written then.
Torrentius thinks it was one of those hymns which by order of the Senate (according to Dion
Cass.) were addressed ιο Augustus as a god, aster the battle of Actium. At that time Mar-
cellus was but in his fourteenth year, but even then Augustus was very fond of him and
had great hopes of him. The poem has much of the appearance of an ode for music,
but a hymn composed on the occasion Torrentius supposes could hardly have failed to
allude ιο the successes it was intended to celebrate. 1 prefer Franke's opinion ιο the
others3 but there is no possibility in my judgment of fixing the date precisely. sanc.
729 appears to be the latest year to which it can be properly assigned, and 725 the
earliest.

Tine opening is taken from the second Olympio ode of Pindar, which begins—

άναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι
τίνα θεὸν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν 3
But the rest of the ode seems ιο be original. Pindar asks whom he shall sing, and im-
mediately sings of Theron. Horace, though he make Augustus the climax of his song,
· goes through the praises of Jove and his children, and then of twelve of Rome's principal
worthies before he comes to Augustus. The common inscriptions therefore ‘⁴ An Auens-
'ww’ or ‘⁸ ns Anousro,” do not seem to express the scope of this ode, which is rather to
celebrate the popular divinities and heroes of Rome than Augustus exclusively3 though
this design is so worked out as ιο draw the chief attention to him.

ARGUMENT.

whom wilt thou sing among gods or men, Clio? Whose name shall the echoes of
Helicon or Pindus repeat, or of Haemus whose woods followed the sweet music of
Orpheus? whom before the almighty Father, who knows no equal or second? After
him cometh Pallas and then breve Liber, and the hunfress Diana, and Phoebus the
archer, and Hercules and Leda's sons, the horseman and the fighter, before whose star
the tempests fly. Then shall it be Romulus, or the peaceful Numa, or proud Tarquin,
or Cato that nobly died? Regulus, and the Scauri, and Paulus, who gave up his great
soul ιο the Carthaginien gratefully 1 will sing, and Fabricius, and Curius, and Camil-
lus, all trained for war in poverty's school, The fame of Marcellus is growing up
insensibly like a tree, and the star of Julius is brighter than all stare. To thee, great
Father, is given the care of Caesar, share with him thy kingdom. Putting Parthians
to ssight and subduing the nations of the East, he shall rule the world as thy vicegerent

ἱξιὴ a righteous sway, while thou dost shake Olympus and hurlest thy bolts upon the
unts o impiety.
