608 HORATII FLAGOI

'EPISTLE XII.
Aac. 734.

locine, ιο whom this Epistle is eddreesed, has been mentioned, with au that is known
of him, in the Introduction to C. i. 29, and Pompeius Grosphus in C. ii. 16. It is ι
letter of inu-oduction for Grosphus to lodus, who was employed in maneging Agiippn's
estates in Sicily.

1t is possible Hormo may heve had n letter from locius in which he wrote something
that gave riso to the reflectione with which the Epistle beginsg bnt to affirm from what
Horace here says thet lodus was a miser or n misanthrope, οι· any thing else but ι good
and sensible mn, any one who reads the Epistle with the melleet attention must see is

ubam-d. The Asgnment will show the spirit of it, and convince any body that Horace

means nothing bnt oompliments ιο hin friend.

The date ie not difficolt to make out. It must have been written shortly ester the
successes of Agrippa against the Cantabri, who, having been nubdned by Augustus in
A-mc. 730, estex-wudu broke out again and were finally conquered ond broken hy Agrippa
Λ.υ.ο. 734, in the autumn of which yem- this Epistle was written. (See v. 29.) At that
time the close of Tiberins' expedition to Armenia, and the restoration of the enudans ot

Crassus would be news just heah.

ARGUMENT-

Use what yon get with discretiori, lodus, and no mn ean be better off than yon. Be
content. He is not poor who has enough. As long a you have good hedth the
riches of kinga eould add nothing to your happiness. Aoeustom yourself to simple
fare and yon will never leave it off, though you should be turned into gold, whethaer it
be thet money makes no change in our natm-es, or because, like a wize man, you count
every thing lesu than virtue. We may wonder why Democritus should heve neglected
his goods to abaoth himself in his studies, when we see how you are able in the midst
of sordid employments ιο lift your thoughts to the ekies, and to see-roh into the springs
of natm-e, and to baloneo rivel systema. ’

Βιιι be all this as it may, 1 beg you to receive Pompeius Grosphus. md whatever he aska
let him have, for he will ask nothing that is not right. Such fn'endz are eheaply
purchased.

If you would know what ia going on at Rome, the cantabriam hes fallen before the volout
of Agrippa, the Arm'eninn of Tiberius. Phraates hos done homage and oeoepted the
yoke of Caesar. Plenty is showering an abundant harvest upon Italy.
