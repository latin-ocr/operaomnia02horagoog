SATIRARUM Ι. 6. 389

SATIRE VI.

In addition to the obloquy brought upon him by 11111 celires. Horace, efter his intimacy
with Maecenas hed begun to be known, had ιο meet the envy such good fortune was eure
to excite. His birth would furnich e handle for the envious, end he wne probably called
an προΐει-ι end hard nemen of thet sort. In this satire, which is nothing but an epistle
to Maecenas, he spurns the iden of hin birth being any objection to him, while et the
neme time he arguet sensibly against men trying ιο get beyond their own legitimete
aphere, end eiming et honours which m only attended with inconvenience, fetigue, end
111 will. This entire, besides the good sense and good feeling it contains, is velueble aa
bearing upon Horece’s life. His introduction ιο Maecenas in told concisely, but fully end
with much propriety end modest„ end nothing cen be more pleesing then the fflial
affection and gratitudo shown in those perte thet relate to his father end the educetion he
gave him. He takes ple-eure in referring whatever mei-its he might have to this good
putent, ee he did in the fourth fletire.

The Setire then may be supposed ιο heve been written chiefly for the purpose of dis·
erming σονς, by showing the modeety of the euthor'e pretensious, und the circumstances
thot led ιο his intimacy with Maecenas. The vim of public life which it contains were
no doubt sincere, and the daily routine described et the end wne better suited to Honoe’·
habit of mind than the fatigues end anxieties of office. There is not the leuet appearance
in any of his writings of his having been spoilt by his good fortune end by his intercourse,
on terme of rere familiarity, with Augustus, Maecenas, end othersg end probably malig-
nity never etteeked any one less decerving of etteek then Horace. There is no great
vigour or variety in thiu piece, end its chief velue is historicul. Attempts heve been
mede to fix upon a dete for ite composition, but when Frenke ceys thet because Horace
declares he might ride to Tarentum if he liked on a mule, without etti-acting any notice,
thoeefore he must letely have been at Tarentum, end must heve written this Setire shortly
nster the esth, end makes his mlculafiom turn chiefly on this point, it my be infel-red
thet there ere no sufficient date for forming any thing like e definite opinion on the
nubject.

ARGUMENT.

Though the blood of kings flowe in your veina, Maecenas, you despice not the humhly
born, euch ee myself e freedmen’s eon. It matters nothing ιο you who ι men's father
was, if he be but ι sreemen born, knowing well thet King Tullus, eye und many before
him, though they hed no tuccetum, were honeet men3 while Laevinus, whose fore-
fethers expelled the Ten-quine, is not worth en es, even 111 the judgment of ι popu-
lece thet stupidly von-ships ancestry. And we who ere so fur above them, how shall
we judge? Allow thet they prefer ι Laevinus with his encestors ιο ι Decius who had
none, end that the censor might degi-ede one who should eapite ιο the senate without
being free born, thet need not alter our judgment. 'l'he censor would act right if he
did ⁸03 let every men keep his own place. But high end low are all willing captivet
