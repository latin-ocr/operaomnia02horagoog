INTRODUGTION. xxi “

The life of Horace was written by Porphyrion, the Scholiast fre-
quently referred to in these notes. He mentions that memoir himself:
‘⁶ Patre libertino natum esse Horatium et in narratione quam de vita
ipsius habui ostendi ’² (on S. i. 6. 41). This same Scholiast refers more
than once to books that had been written on the persons mentioned by
Horace. A reference to Estre’s work spoken of in the Preface will
show that a catalogue of these persons embraces nearly all the distin-
guished men of the day, with most of whom Horace was on friendly
terma.

The Metres adopted by Horace from the Greek are thirteen in num-
ἰῖιὲῑει ghleegges and six in the Epodes. I purpose saying only a few

O. i. 1.—-The metre of this Ode is one of three, called after Ascle-
ἷζε-8, a lyric poet of uncertain date. It consiste of single lines divided

The caesura usually falls at the end of the second foot. There are two
exceptions only in Horace, ii. 12. 25, and iv. 8. 17. The Greeks did
not follow this rule, and their lines were less monotonous in con·
sequence. The division of this metre by choriambics is against the
obvious rhythm. O. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to the same.

O. i. 2.—This metre takes its name from Sappho. It consists of
stanzas of four verses each. The three first are alike, and con-ist of
four trochees, with a dactyl in the third place. Horace always sub-
stitutes a spondee for the second trochee, with one uncertain exception,
C. S. ¹70. The fourth verse consiste of a dactyl and spondee.

This is one of the commonest metres. It differs in Horace's hands ’

from the Greek usage by the less frequent introduction of the trochee
in the second place, and from the caesura usually falling after the fifth
syllable. This arrangement takes away a good deal from the vigour of
the metre, a defect which Horace seems to have perceived when he

wrote the Carmen Seculare and the Sapphic Odes of the fourth book ².

⁷ 1 subjoin some remarks from the ⁴⁶ Journal of Education” 1832 (vol. iv. p. 356),
on Dr. Carey's “Latin Prosody made Easy.” The author observes: ¹⁴ It greatly cou-
duoes to the harmony os the Sapphic verse to make the caesura at the fifth semisoot, as
⁸ Dive, quem proles Niobea magnae3' not as ⁴ Haec Jovem sentire Deosque cunctos,’ ”—
a very common opinion. To which the reviewer replica: ‘⁸ To our ears the latter is at
least as melodious as the former, consisting of a dactyl interposed between two accentual
ditrochaeo, as in the lines quoted by Dr. Carey from Catullus and Sappho:

‘ ποιειλόθρον’ ἀθάνατ’ Ἀφροδίτα]
⁴ Pauca nuntiate meae puellae ς’
