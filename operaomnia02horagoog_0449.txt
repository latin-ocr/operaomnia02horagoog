opinion. The plural σάββατα is commonly
used by the writers of the New Testament
for the sabbath day. The joke‚ however,
would have little point if it were not the
fact that there were at Rome superstitious
people, especially women and ns of
nervous habit and of the lower orders (see
S. ii. 3. 291, n.), who, being ready to be
influenced by any superstition, were pre·
pared to be frightened at the statements of
the J ewa, who were zealous in making prose-
lytes (see S. 4. 143), and no doubt ten-ified
some by their representation of the curses
denounced upon the transgressore of the
sabbath. ovid, advising a man how to get
out of love, bids him above all things go
away from his mistress, and let nothing
stop him (Rem. Am. 219):

‘⁸ Nec pluzias vites nec te peregrina mo-
ren ur

Sabbata, nec damnis Allia nota suis.”

72. Huncine colem Tam uiarum eur-
reoee] ⁴ Huncine ’ is compounded of the
pronoun, the demonstrative enclitic ⁶ oe ³
(for ‘ ecce,’ ⁸ behold ’)‚ and the interrogative
enclitic ‘ne' (Key’s 1.. G. 293). As to
⁶ surrexe‚’ see S. i. 5. 79³ and Terence (Ad.
iv. 2. 22), “Non tn eum rus hinc modo
Produxe aibas? ”

74. Gaea venit obvius mn· Adversarius]
Whether this ‘ adversarius ’ is the same
person who was plaintiff in the action
above referred to has been questioned.
The point turns on the expression ⁴ rapit in
jus ’ (v. 77). ⁴ In jus vocare ’ is a technical
expression having reference to the first
step in a civil action when both parties ap-
peared before the praetor or other magis·
tratus having ‘jurisdictim’ with the view of
fixiug a day for the commencement of the
trial. On this occasion the ⁴ vadimonium ’
above described was entered into. Thia
first step was usually avoided by the parties
arranging the day between themselves. and
giving each other security for their attend-
ance. But when the defendant was obsti-
nate and ill-disposed, the ‘in jus vocatio ’
was resorted to. ⁶ In jus vocare,’ the-erote,
being the first step, could not follow upon
the neglect of the ⁴ vadimonium ' by Horace's

Fugit improbus ac me
Casu venit obvius illi
Adversarius et: “ Quo tu turpissime 2'' magna
Inclamat voce ; et “ Licet antestari 3⁹·

companium and the ⁸ adversarius ³ in this
case cannot be the plaintiff in the other, nn-
less Horace is speaking loosely. But as this
unprincipled fellow may very probably have
had plenty of creditor-s, there is no reason
why Horace’s deliverer should not be a new
one sent by Apollo to his rescae. If we
are to suppose the two to be identical, then
Horace means that the plaintifl', not satisfied
with the forfeit of the ⁴ vadimonium‚' would
go through with the action, and hurried his
adversary ofl' to the praetor, as he might do
insuchacase. If thstbe so, Horacenses
a legal term in an unusual way, from want
of accurate knowledge of the langnage of
the courts. The above will be found
better stated in Mr. Iaong's note referred to
on v. 36, where the inconsistency between
Orelli’a views and his quotations from
Plautus is also shown.

76. Licet antestari ι’] This word significa
the calling a bystander to witness that there
was nothing illegal in the conduct of the
plaintifl' in such a case as the above, and that
the defendant had resisted, and that fame
was necessary. The process w'as by touching
the ear of the person whose testimony was
asked, who could not be compelled to be a
witness, but after he had consented he was
bound to appear and give evidence if re-
quired. Horace was only too glad to help
in the forcible removal of his persecutor,
and gavehisearwithallreadinaes. The
parties begin towranglez a ‹nowdof idlers
of course forms round them, and Horace
makes his escape. The meaning of ‘in J'us
vocatio ’ and ¹ antestari ’ is sufficiently
grai-15& in a passage of Plautus (Pers. iv.
