98. Num te semper inops] The MSS.
and editions vary here again. The read·
inge are ‘num,' ‘nom’ ‘nef and ‘nec.’
Bentley has ⁴ ne,' which is the reading of
most of the editions of the sixteenth cen-
tury, and of several MSS. of Lambinus,
Cruquius, Fea, and others. ⁴ Non ’ is the
reading of Ven- 1483, and others of that
century3 but it has 110 meaning, and 1
take it to be a corruption of ⁴ num! ‘ Ne ’
1 imagine to be later, than ⁴ non ' which

loo. Virtutem doctrina paret,] Whe-
ther virtue is 6 60161166 interium) and
capable of being taught ( ιόαιετὴ) 16 dis-
cussed by Socrates in Plato' s dialogus
Menon. He hold that virtue consiste in
1116 66161166 of good 3 that to be virtuous we
must know what is good, for we must do
what is good because we know it to be
good, 01 there is no virtue in doin it. He
held that we have a moral sense y which
good is perceived, but the moral sense, like
other faculties, requires to be strengtheued
and assisted b instruction, aud to that ex-
tent virtue is ιδακτῆ. Pmcticffly this ap·
pears to have been the doctrine of Socrates.
It is e in several places in the
Memorabilia, as in l. ii. c. 6, ξ 39: ὅσαι
δ’ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἀρεταὶ λέγονται, exorruit·
μενος εὑρήσεις πάσας μαθήσει τε καὶ με·
λίπῃ αὐξανομένας. Comp. iii. 9. 1, and
iv. 1. 3, sqq. Antisthenes and the Cynica
held the same opinion, in the following out
of which Socrates himselfwas led into some
contradictione. The question was 6 common
rhetorical themo in Horace's day= hence
Cicero mentions it with other kindred topics

104. yelidus Diyentia rivum] The Di-
gentia (Licenza) was a small stream which,
rising near Horace's 1101166 (666 Epp. 16.
12, n.), after a course of about six miles,
emptied itself into the Anio, about half a
mile beyond the Via Valeria, which crossed
it. De Chaupy (iii. 156) says with refer-
ence to the epithet ‘gelidum’ ⁴⁴ Ses eaux
tirent de leur origine une fraicheur qu’elle
conservent dans une vallee aussi close, et

que l'air plns libre qu’elles trouvent apres .

elle n’est capable que d'augmenter.” There

root of Monte Cantalupo, at the head of
the valley of Licenza, and on the banks of
the stream which separatos it from Vico
Varo (Varia, Bpp. 14. 3). Walckenaer
(Hist. p. 412) says it is about four and two-
thirds Roman miles west of Licenza, which
he identifies with Ustica (C. i. 17. 11).
De Chaupy places it about the same dis-
tance. He explains from his own observa-
tion how, through its position at the head
of the valley, and the winda that blow upon
it from the north-east, it was colder than
Horace's residence higher up the valley, by
way of reconciling the description ⁴ rugosus
frigore pagus ' with ⁴ temperiem laudes ⁹ in
Epp. 16. 8. He gives 6 sepulchral inscrip-
tion, 01· date not earlier than the establish-
ment of Christianity, dug up in the last

where De Chaupy sa'ys ⁴ massa' is equivalent
to ⁴ pagus' or hamlet. The word isflound
in other sepulchral inscriptions, in some
of which it cannot bear that meaning, and
a different interpretation is given to it by
Pabretti (see Fon-ooli). But the inscription
sufficiently shows the site of Mandela. The
expression ⁴ rugosus frigore pagus ' may be
suggested by pictur-es and other representa-
