wars of Bacchus with the giants aud in says that from his childhood he shewed in

India.1n the ode celebrating the praises
of Dionlysus (ii. 19) we have⁴ ⁴Evoe, parce
Liber, Parce, gravi metuende thyrso·” and
below (Epp. ii. l. 5) his apotheosis is spoken
of (as also in C. iv. 8. 34), where there is
the additional confusion that he is called by
his essentially Latin title ⁴ Liber pater! It
must be borne in mind therefore that,
though the poets eonfound these names,
Liber was a Latin divinity, while Dionysus
was entirely Greek3 and that when the
orgies of the latter were introduced into
Italy they were expelled again, the Liber-
alia, an innocent and cheerful festival,
lffitig substituted for the impure rites of the
ionysia.

5. Vina sere dulces] The ancients did
not spare the reputation of their poeta in
this matter, for besides the fame of Cra-
tinus mentioned above, Alcaeus, Anam-eon,
Aeschylus, Aristophanes, and many others,
have the credit ol* indulging freely in wine.
As to Homer, there is no foundation in his
poetry for Horace’s libel, which is simply
absurd. David might as well be charged
with excess because he speaks of wine as
making glad the heart of man. Ennius
said of ghimself that he only wrote when he
had got the gout· “Nunquam postor nisi

8. Forum pateatque Libonis] See S. ii.
6. 35, ιι. Horace speaks asif he had de-
livered an ⁴edictum' that the business of
the Forum was only fit for the sober and
dull, who had nothing to do with poetry;
whereupon all that would be thought poets
took to drinking day and night. 'rho old
editions and a large number of MSS. have
⁴ edixit! Bentley restored ‘edixi,’ for which
there is ample authority. ⁴ Putere ' is a
atr-onger word for ⁴ olere,' used above, v. 5.

12. Quid, ei qais vultu torvo] Cato of
Utica is here referred to, of whom Plutarch

his voice and countenanee, and also in his
amusements, an immoveable, unimpressite,
and firm temper. He seldom hughed or
even smiled3 and, though not passionate.
when his anger was roused it was not eas-y
to pacify him. He set himself against the
fashionsof the times in dress asin other
things, and often went out of door-a asten·
dinner without his shoes and tanim and
the fashion being to wear a ‘lacerna’
of bright colour.. he chose to wear a dal-k

of the day. — ‘’Textore is oddly used here,
where we should expect ⁴ textina-³ 'nm
observation of Comm. eruq„ ⁴⁴ Textor hie
proprium nomen est inventoris exiguae
togae‚'' is absurd.

15. Rupit Iarbitam nmquis] It ap-
pears that the person here called lubitu
was aMauritanian by birth, and that his
Roman name was Cordus or Codrus.
(Scholiast quoted by Cruquius in his Supple-
ment, and by Fea.) Timagenes was a na-
tive of Alexandria, where he was taken
prisoner by A. Gabinius and sold as a slave.
He was sent to Rome and bought by
Faustus, the sou of Sulla, who gave him
his freedom. He aflei-warda taught rhe-
toric, and got into favour with Augustus,
butwassofreewith his tonguethathe
offended his patron, and was forbidden his
house. He afterwards ingratiated himself
with Asinius Pollio, who gave him a home
in his house at Tusculum, where he died.
The Scholiasts agree in saying that Cordus,
called larbitas (whether by Horace in joke
or generally by his contemporaries), ᾶοιιι
Virgil's Numidian king Iarbas, endeavour-
ing to imitate Timagenes, and failing
broke his heart with envy. Porphyrion
