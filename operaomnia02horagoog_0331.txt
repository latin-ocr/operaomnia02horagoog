CARMEN XIV.

Y

Thst Maecenas was not men-led, or engaged to be married, in sanc. 720, is insa-red
from the fect thet in ι letter written in thet yeer ιο Augustus by M. Antonius he munte
. him with carrying οιι ιιι inti-igue with Terentia (Suet- Octev. 69. quoted by Franks).
Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 28) supposes Maecenas did not marry till he hed built his house
on the Campus Esquilinus, A.u.c. 721-22. His domestic happiness wss not of long
continusnce. But he could hardly heve come to the end of it when Horace wrote this
ode, in which allusion is plainly mede ιο Terentia end her husband’s affection for her
(supposing them to have been married st the time, and not merely ben-othed, es Kirchner
imagines). These dete leave ι wide specs for the composition of the ode. The object of
it is to excuae Horace for his indolence in not having finished ι poem, or volume of
poems, he hed long promised. It is generally essmed thet this ⁴ carmen olim promissum'
was the book of Epodes we now possess. If so, the ode was not written long before the
publication of the volume ε for if it had long been promised and was anxiously expected
(ss Bentley says), we cen hardly suppose that ester being stin-ned up by his patum, md with
the leisure he must have hed ιι his farm, Horace would have kept Maecenas end ⁸11 his
friends in further suspense for my length of time, especially when we consider that the work
was not ιιι Aeneid‚ but ι meme collection of comparative trifles, some of which must heve
been written early, md of which but few could heve eost their author any particular amount
of thought. Now one of these odesst least (C. ix.) was written ss lete ιε 723, being com-
posed immediately ester the battle of Actium, end the first is elmon univer-sully allowed
to heve been written just before that battle. The book therefore, under this explanation
of ⁸ promissum carmen) was ιιοι published ιι the earliest till towards the end of Α.σ.ο.
723, end thus the ode apologizing for its delsy could not have been written much before
then. Frenke essigns two odes (2 snd 17) to the following year 724, while this spology
he pleoes in 721-22. In this cese Horace must have gone on dswdling with his book ιι
ι very elow rste, which under the drcumstences it is difficult to account for.

After ⁸11 it is doubtful whether ⁴ promissum carmen ' means this book of Bpodea.
Doexing considers it certain that it wss ι single poem. (See note on v. 8).
