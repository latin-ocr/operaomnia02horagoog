CARMEN XXXIV.

If Horace hed any serious meaning in this ode, as 1 think he had, it is to be supposed
he wrote it under some impulse of conscience, which told him that he had been too care-
less of that sovereign power which governs all things. The language, though impulsive,
appears genuine3 and whether it was through the phenomenon here mentioned or any
otha· cause that his mind was impressed, he seems to express more than merely poetical
feeling, and the power acknowledged is not that conventional For-tune of the next ode,
but the Supreme Being who declares his existence by the voice of conscience, through
sudden impressione and startling signs, such as under some form οι· other we may believe
Horace was struck with.

1 believe Buter was the first from the word ‘apicem ' (v. 14) to suppose an allusion
to the Parthians and the muster of the power from Phraates to Tiridates, or back from
Tiridates to Phraates. This opinion is generally adopted nov, and Buttmann has given
it his sanction. He says ⁴⁸ ape-2· is the peculial· name for the head-dress of the Persian
kings3 and, just about the time when by the most probable calculation the odes of thia
book must have been written, a revolution took place in the Parthian empire, the most
poverful state in the world next to Rome, whereby Tiridates was dethroned and driven
out of the connis-y, and Phraates was re-established in his stead.” More weight 1 think
is given to these words than they deserve- Chronologicslly considered they must be
