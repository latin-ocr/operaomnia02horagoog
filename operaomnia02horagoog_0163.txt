138 HORATII FLAGGI

Somnum reducent. Somnus agrestium
’ Lenis virorum non humiles domos
Fastidit umbrosamque ripam,

Non Zephyris agitata Tempe.
Desiderantem quod satis est neque 25
Tumultuosum sollicitat mare,

Nee saevus Arcturi cadentis
Impetus aut orientis Haedi,
Non verberatae grandine vineae
Fundusque mendax, arbore nunc aquas 3ο
Culpante nune torrentia agros
Sidera nunc hiemes iniquas.
Contracta pisces aequora sentiunt
J actis in altum molibus ; huc frequens
anmenta demittit redemptor 3⁵
Cum famulis dominusque terrae

‘ elaborarunt,’ as referring to Damocles.
But the future has most authority, and
Horace is laying down a maxim, not relat-
ing a fact. Cic. (Tusc. Disp. v. 21) tells
the story of Damocles with reflectione simi-
larto these. Compare Persius (iii. 40) :—
⁴⁴ Auratis pendens laquearibus ensis
Purpureas subter eervices termit.”

20. Non avium] Seneca (de Provid. iii.,)
quoted by Dillenbr., says thatM Maecenas

sought sleep by the help of distant music.

21. Somnus ayo-estium] Acron and Por·
phyrion, whom Dillenbr. follows, make
‘agrestium virorum ’dependent on *8οιιιιιιι.·ι,’
which destroys the prosopopoeia. Dillenbr.,
in his Quaestiones Horatianae, has ‹ii-awti
ffifflffit‘ssiffiffisshtffissmsssgeoe &3333
many others. He gives several instances,
and they are numerous enough to consti-
tute a feature in Horace's style. ‘⁴ Spiritum
Graiae tenuem Camoenae,'' is one instance
out of many. Itis said to ariae out of the
liking the Intin poets had for homoeote-
leuga Arcturi cadentis—orientis Haedi,]
Arcturus sets the beginning of November.
The constellation Auriga, os which the kids
(two stare) form a part, rises the beginning
of October.

29. . verberatae prandisse vineae] · 800

tisoertsfides” (C. iii. 10. 30). Astheolive-

tree complains of the rain, so Gesner would
have the field abuse the drought and the
sturm, putting ⁸ agro' for ⁴ agros,’ aud snp-
posingthefinal ‘s’ to have ιιι-1000 out of

any other emendation but Gesner’ s been

are not among Horace' s happiest. But that
is no reason for altering or abandoning them.

32. Contracta pisces aequora sentinat]
Compare C. ii. 18. 20, -

Marisque Baiis qbstrepenta's urges

andEpp. i. 1. 84,—

“si dixit dives, lacus et mm sentit amorem

35. Gaementa demittit redemtor] eom-
pare C. iii. 24. 8, sq. :—

⁴⁴ caementis licet occupes

The walls were seced on either side with
stone, and loose stones (caementa) were
tbi-own in between. ‘’Frequens goes with

means ‘cum freqfflnti famulorum turha!
Others say it means ⁴ stoquentoe! 1 think
it means this, or· many a redemptor. ‘Re-
