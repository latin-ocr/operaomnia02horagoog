SATIRA RUM Ι. 7.

Acres procurrunt, magnum spectaculum uterque.
Persius exponit causam; ridetur ab omni
Conventu; laudat Brutum laudatque cohortem:
Solem Asiae Brutum appellat, stellasque salubres

Appellat comites excepto Rege; canem illum
Invisum agricolis sidus venisse.

understood, that word being used as a sub-
stantive for ‘ a pair,’ both in the singular,
as here, and Ovid Met. xiii. 833: ‘⁴ Parve
columbarum demptusve cacumine nidus ;”
and the plural, as Cic. Lael. c. 4: ‘⁸ Ex om·
nibus saeculis vix tria ant quatuor nominan-
tur paria amicorum.’' So in the Epistle
{o Livia attributed to Ovid (v. 301), we
ave·—

“ Par bene compositum: juvenum sortis-
simus alter,
Altera tam forti mutua cura viro.”

The received reading in Bentley’s time was
‘ compositus :’ on the anthon'ty of one MS.
of no weight he altered it to ‘compositi.'
‘ compositum ’ appears to have very good
authority. Bithus and Bacchius were gla-
diators, according to the Scholiasta, of great
repnte, who after having in their time
killed many antagonists finally killed each
other. Acron says they are mentioned by
Suetonius, hut their names do not appear
in his existing works. The MSS. and edi-
tions vary between ⁴ concurrunt' and ‘ pro-
currunt! The old editions bave the former,
bnt ‘ procnrrunt’ is the more forcible word
and is now generally received. As to ‘ in
jus,’ see S. 9. 77.

22. ridetur ab omni Conventa ,·] ‘Ride-
tur’ is used impersonally. On the proper
meaning of ‘ conventus,’ which was a meet-
ing, at fixed times and places, of the inhabit-
ants of a province for the purpose of settling
disputes and transacting business, and which
was also applied to certain districts ont of
which such meetings were composed, see
Long's note on Cic. in Verr. ii 2. 13.

23. laudatque cohortem:] The official
staff of a provincial governor was called
his ⁸ cohors ’ and ⁴ comites! See Epp. i. 3.
6: ‘⁴ Quid studiosa cohors operum struit.’'
8. 2: ‘⁴ (Celso) comiti scribaeque Neroni.”
14: ‘⁴ Ut placeat juveni percontare utque
cohorti.” The lower officials, who did not
belong to the ⁸ cohors,' but were a good
deal about the person of the governor,

Cicero speaks of as those ‘⁸ qui qnasi ex
cohorte praetoris appellari solent '’ (Ad
Qu. Fr. l. i. Ep. l, c. 4, where see Long’s
note). See Catullus (x. lo, sqq.) :—

“ Nec praetoribus esse nec cohorti
Cur quisquam capnt unctius referret,
Praesertim quibus esset irrumator
Praetor nec faceret pili cohortem.''

He also addrcsses Verannins and Fabullus
as “ Pisonis comites cohors inanis ” (xxviii.
1). ‘Comes’ was retained as a title of
honour during the empire, and has survived
to the present day in the word ⁴ count!

25. canem] The ‘dog—star,' as opposed
to the ⁶ stellae salubres) ‘ Excepto Rege ⁷
shows that Rupilius belonged to the ⁴ cohors,’
and therefore held a post of trust about
Brutus.

27. fertur quo rara securim] Between
precipitons banks covered with trees where
the axe seldom comes from their inaccessi-
ble position.

28. multoque fluenti] The editors till
Bentley had ⁴ multum ;' and all, with the
exception of Dacier, including the Scho-
liasta, referred the words to ⁸ arbusto,’ with
what meaning it is hard to imagine, even
with their notes before one. Torrentius first
brought the reading ‘ multo ' to light srom
some MSS. of good character, and it has
since appeared in many. Bentley quotes
322{.?333,35.3?'23§¹3 Ξεζῖιῖἓίὂῑῖἰέῗ

29. Expressa arbusto] The illustration
Horace chooses for the abuse which the
enraged Rupilius hurls back (⁴ regerit ⁹)
