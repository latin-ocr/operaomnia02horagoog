Cunctane prae Campo et Tiberino flumine sordenti

An venit in votum Attalicis ex urbibus una, 5
An Lebedum laudas odio maris atque viarum?

Scis Lebedus quid sit; Gabiis desertior atque

direct question, is rare, and perhaps li-
mited in the best writers ιο ‘necness
(Key' s L. G. 1528, n.) If‘ minorane ’be
the true reading, ‘foma' must be followed
hy s note of interrogation.

5. Attalicis es· urbibus] One of the
towns of the kingdom of Pergamum be-
queathed by Attalus 111. to the Roman
people, und constituted a Romen province
on the defeat ot· Aristonicus, A.u.c. 625.
The foi-trees of Pergamum in Mysis was
eutrusted by Lysimachus to his officer Phi-
letaerus, who made himself independent,
und held the town audite vast nessures, of
which he had charge, for twenty years, be-
ginning mc. 283. His successor, Eumenes
1., defeated the army of Antiochus the
Great near Sardes, snd added some of the
surrounding country to his possessione, to
which his successor Attalus Ῑ. added more
by the conquest of the Gallo· Graeci, and he
first took the title of king of Pergamum.
His successore, adher-ing to the alliance of
the Romans, got the beneflt of their suc-
cesses against Antiochus ς and the kingdom
of Pergamum, when it was handed over to
the Romans, included Mysia, Lydia, Ionia,
and part of Caria, the principal cities of
which (μητροπόλεις) were Ephesus, Perga-
mum, Sardes, Smyrna, lampsacus, Cyzicus.
Other large towns were Tralles, Adramyt-
tium, Th5stirs, δια, nearly all of which are
shown by the ruins thet remsin to have
been built and ornamented on s magnificent
scale.

6. An Lebedum laudae Lysimachus,
efter the battle of Ipsus ιι. c. 3⁰1). when
he became master of the western part of
Asia Minor, (ἰδίω yed the towns of p-Lebe
dus sud Colophon ιιι Ionis, und transferred
their inhabitants ιο Ephesus. Lebedus never
seems to have been rebuilt so as to recover
any of its former importance, snd the ruins
of the old town probably helped to cause
the desolate appearance described by Ho-
race. There are some ruins still in ex-
istence, marking the spot where this town
stood, now called Ecclesia, or Xingi
(Cramer). Horace writes as if he knew
Lebedus, but did not know the other places
he refers to before. He must have seen
this place, if st all, in his campaigning with
Brutus.

Gabii was sn ancient town of Latium, sn

Alban colony, 10⁰ stedia from Rome, which

” excavations, made about the end of the last

century, show to have stood οιι a plsee
now called l’Osteria del Pantsno (Cramer).
In Cicero⁹ s time it was a municipium (Pro

Plnnc. c. 9). During the civil ware it fell
into ruins3 so that Lucan says,

Gabios, Veiosque, Coramque
Pulvere vix tectae poterunt monstrare rui·
nae⁹ ⁹(vii. 392).

Propertius mentions its desei-tion end for·
mer grestness in one line,—

“ Et qui nunc nulli maxima turba Gabi.⁹⁹

Juvenal menu'ons it as s place of resort for

people in humhle circumstances, ss—

“ Quis timet sut timuit gelida haenoete
Aut ῗοῗίῖἰῗήοωοιοω inter juga Volsiniis,
Simgl'idibus Gabiis?⁹⁹ (iii. 190).

“- jam celebres notique poete-e

Balneolnm Gabiis, Romae conducere furnos
Tentsrent ⁹⁹ (vii. 3).

In Horace⁹s time, while cold bething was
the fashion under the advice of Antonius
Musa, it appears Gabii was resorted to.
Horace may have been there himself. See
Epp. 15. 9. sse wwn was restored under
the Emperors Antoninus sud Commodus,
snd recovered some importsnce. There
was s temple of Juno st Gabii, of which
some remeius are said to exist still. Several
statues and inscriptions were found when
the excavations took place.

Fidenae was about five miles from Rome,
in the Sabine territory, of which remsins are
still in existence near Cnstel Giubileo
schama) Ῑιι Ass-c. 329 the town was

estroyed by Aemilius Mamercus (Liv. iv.
9). Previous to this it had been one of
the most troublesome of the Bonum pos-
sessione, making many efforts to recover-

its independence. According to tradition
Romulus found it a town and con-

 

quered it (Dionys. Helie. ii. 23), but it
seems never to have risen to any great im
portance again. It appears from Tacitus
(Ann. iv. 62) that Fidenae was n muni
cipium in the time of Tiberius. He relates,
in his own style, a dreadsul accident by the
falling of a temporat-y amphitheatre, by
which he says 50, 000 persons were killed
