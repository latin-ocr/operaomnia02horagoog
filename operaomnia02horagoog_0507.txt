HORATII FLAGGI

Accipe quid contra juvenis responderit aequus:
In nive Lucana dormis ocreatus ut aprum

Goenem ego ; tu pisces hiberno ex aequore verris.

editions have ‘ vellis, which Aaou (who

mentions the Ἣ* verris ') explains
“cum difficultate ' .” Cruqnius ssys
all his MSS. have ‘vei-dest which Lam·
binus also adopts. Bentley does the same
