hu “Secretusque pios-’⁹ But these prove
nothing, but rather lead to the inference
that, if Horace had used a compound of
⁴ cerno ’ here, he would have used ⁴ semotas!

tartham] On this Acron says: “Querebatur
autem Sappho de puellis suis civibus quia
non amarent quem ipsa diligebat ;” which
Porphyrion varies thus: “ quia Oden non
ament uem ipsa diligebat amens? Cru-
quius' choliast explains their meaning,
and shows the corruption of their text. He

tendemeas with which Sappho could write
to her young female friends, and her jealousy
of rivals in their affectione, imply a state of
feelings which we cannot very well enter
into in our present social condition. A
woman could only write to her lover now
in such language as Sappho could address
to Atthis, a young friend and pupil who had
transferred her affections to Andromeda, a
rival of the poetess :—

''Bpoc δηῦτέ μ’ ὁ λυσιμελὴς δύνει

γλυκύπικρον ἀμάχανον ἵρπετον·

’Aa-01, σοὶ d' ἐμέθεν μὲν ἀπῆχθιτο

φροντίσδην, ἐπὶ δ’ Ἀνδρομέδαν ndi-p.
(43 Bagk.)

The affection of Soa-ates for some of his
young pupils was of that sublimated kind
which was liable to be mistaken for a grosser
feeling ς and Ι consider it next to impossible
for any modern reader fully to enter into the
language of the ‘⁸ Phaedrae· and comprehend
the quality of the feelings there described
as Plato understood them, if he did under-
stand them. On the subject os Sappho the
reader may consult Miiller’s Dorians, B. iv.

chaps. 4‚§8, and 5, §23 and the same
writer’s History of Greek Lit. p. 176, sqq.

⁴ humeris? and desiring an epithet for ⁸ aure,'

before him when he wrote. Bentley is not
confident that Horace wmte ‘avidaf but
thinks he would have done better if he had.

33. caminibus] This is the ablative
case. as (S. i. 4. 28) ⁴⁸ Stupet Albius aere.”
(S. ii. 7. 95) “Vel quum Pausiaca torpe-¹,
insane, tabella.”

34. centiceps] Elsewhere Horace repre-
sents Cerberus with three heads (C. ii. 19.
31), and (C. iii. ΙΙ. 20); in the latter of
which places, which greatly resembles this
and should be compared with it, he describes
him with a hundred snakes guarding his
head. Hesiod represents him with fisty
heads, but three is the more usual account.
bandinus reads ‘centipes,’ and supposes
Briareus to be meant. Where he got his
reading from does not appear. It is not
among the emendations enumerated in his
own list, but occurs in a late MS„ which
Jani attributes to the end of the fourteenth
century, and to which, having seen it, he
attributes some value.

35. intorti] The MSS. favour this read·
ing, though ‘anguis’ is more commonly
feminine than masculine.
