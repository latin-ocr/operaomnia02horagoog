CARMEN XVII.

The short ode, C. i. 26, sud this ode were addressed to the seme person, 1⁴. Aelius Inmiu
(see Introduction to C. i. 26). The languege of the former ode hus led to the inference
thet Lamia was u young men of desponding disposition, end this that he was proud und
vein-glorious,—n sort of criticism imper-tinent end unrensoneble us it seems to me. What
is clear is no more than thet Lamia was e young man of good birth, being of the Aelia
gens, who were plebeiens, but of old standing. Like other fumilies the Lumine were per-
haps glad to trsce their origin to a sabulone hero, end believed their founder to be Lamus,
king of the hestrygoninnu, end builder of Formiae, ’from whence they must heve mi-
greted to Rome (see lest ode, v. 33, n.). Horace hed evidently nn affection for the young
men hmin, whose father was a. friend of Cicero's, end died rich. It is not improbable
the ode was written nt his house in the country, whether st Formiae (“ quod valde pro-
babile,” says Jani, 1 don't see why) or elsewhere. It hes no particular merit, und could
have eost Horace little labour. He must heve written many such thet heve never been
published, und these two odes were probably included in the collection out of compliment
to lamia. But there is not the least resson why Horace should be supposed not to have
been the author of the ode; end though it might do very well, perhaps better, without
the verses 2—5, which some editors would atrike out (J nni says, ‘⁶ haud dubie spurii sunt,”
und has a long excursus to prove it), but no MSS. omit, it is the very worst species of
criticism thet endeavours to bring, by corrections, omissione, end additions, the received
text into conformity with some standard which is presumed to represent the mind end
style of the author. lt· this system were not so common, especially among the commen-
tatore on Horace, old end new, it would seem superfluous to suy e word about it. himin
had a brother Quintus, who died early, to the great grief of Lucius (see Epp. i. 14. 6).
There was one of this family, according to the Scholiasts Acron end Porphyrion, who
wrote comedies ς but there is no resson to suppose it was Horace’s friend. In two pes-
ssges Juvenal alludes to the hmine es s family of distinction (Β. iv. 154) 2—

“ Sed periit postquam cerdonibus esse timendus
Coeperat ; hoc nocuit Lamiarum caede medenti.''
(π. 384) ¹ ‘⁶ Quaedam de numero Lamiarum ec nominis Appi
Et ferre et vino Junum Vestamque rog-ubst,”

Lamia, says his ⁶ genus’ was ⁴ docorum?

ARGUMENT.

from him who founded Formiae end ruled on the benks of the Liris), a storm is coming,
