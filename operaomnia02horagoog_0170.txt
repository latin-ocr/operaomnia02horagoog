CARMINUM III. 3.

145

In pulverem, ex quo destituit deos
Mercede pacta Laomedon, mihi
castaeque damnatum Minervae
Oum populo et duce fraudulento.

J am nec Lacaenae splendet adulterae

85

Famosus hospes nec Priami domus
Perjura pugnaees Achivos
Hectoreis opibus refringit,
N ostrisque ductum seditionibus

Bellum resedit.

Protinus et graves

⁸0

Iras et invisum nepotem
Troica quem peperit sacerdos
Marti redonabo; illum ego lucidas
Inire sedes, ducere nectaris

Succos, et adscribi quietis

³5

Ordinibus patiar deorum.
Dum longus inter saeviat Ilion
Romamque pontus qualibet exsules

In parte regnanto beati ;

Dum Priami Paridisque busto

which gives some coloni· to the reading
⁸ patris, but not much, and the MSS. and
editions are all in favour of ‘ Martis! See
note on Epod. xvi. 13.

21. ea· quo] This significa that the fall
of Troy was determined from the time of
homedon's crime, and that the crime of
Paris and Helen caused its aceomplishment.
‘ Destituo ' with an ablative is unusual.

23. damnaturis] Bentley prefers ⁶ dam-
natam: leet there should be any doubt
whether Horace meant to say ⁴ Ilion dam-
natum’ or ‘pulverem damnatum! Ι do
not think there can be any doubt. The
feminine form ⁴ Ilios ' occurs elsewhere
(Epod. xiv. 14).

25. adulterae] It is doubtful whether
Horace meant this for the dative or genitive
εἴη. Doering thinks the formem Orelli

e latter.

28. νςΐήιιρίω Au the meanings of this
word, which here means to repel, are well
given by Foroen. with examples.

- 29. ductam] ⁴ Ducere' and ‘trahere'
for‘producere’ and ‘protrahere’ areusages
well known.

32. stoica] There is no authority for
⁴ 'I'ro'ia ς’ but Bentley adopts it here and in
i. 6. 1⁴3 also sani and Rea, the vray having
been led by Heinsius. There is much ωσι-ιι

40

in J uno’s language, as in the words ⁶ mulier
peregrina,’ ⁶ Troica sacerdos,' ⁴ fatalis inces-
tusque judex,' ⁶ exsules!

33. Redonabo ,·] This word occurs only
here and above (ii. 7. 3).

34. ducere nectaria] Many MSS. have
⁴ discere,' and Porphyrion explains it, “ aa·
suescere saporibus nectaris. ³ But ‘ suc-
cus ⁹ means juioe, not flavour, and to that
sense ⁸ ducere' is well suited. The same
mistake appears in some of the MSS. in
Ovid (A. Am. iii. 353) :—

“ ——- telorum ducere jactus

Ut scelat?

Dillenbr. among others hes ⁸ discere.’ 1 do
not like it at all, in the face espedally of
the very common use of ⁶ ducere,’ in this
sense of quaffing. So the Greeks used
ἕλκειν and σπᾷν. They both occur in one
verse of Euripides (Cycl. 417),

ἔσπασέν r' ἄμυστιν ἑλκύσας.

35. quietis Ordinibus . . . deorum] This
savours of the Epicureanism Horace had
learnt in early Πίος “ deos didici securum
agere sevum! (S. i. 5. 101.)

“ Scilicet is superis labor est, ea cura quietos

Sollicitat-‚2⁹ (Aen. iv. 379.)

40. Priami- burto] Priam had no
tomb according to Virgil's account (Aen. ii.
