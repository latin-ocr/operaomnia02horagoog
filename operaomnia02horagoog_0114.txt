CARMEN ΙΙ.

Am. e. 730.

Horace, meaning to write an ode on the moderate desire and use of wealth, dedicated it
ιο C. Sallustius Crispus, grand-nephar of the historiari aud inheritor of his property. He
had previously alluded ιο him in no terms of praise in Sat. i. 2. 483 but that Satire was
written many years before this ode, and at this time Sallustius was iu high favour with
Augustus and possessed of great richer, of which Horace implies that he made a good use.
From the reference to Phraates' return to his throne (v. 17). which took place Α.σ.ο. 729
(see C. i. 26, Introduction), the ode must have been written aster that event. Proculeius
mentioned in v. fi was brother or cousin (it is not certain which) to Licinius Murena,
who A.u.c. 732 was detected in a conspiracy with one Fannius Caepio to take away the
life of Augustus (see C. ii. lo. Introduction). 1 cannot infer so positively as Fiunke and
others do that Horace would have abstained from mentioning the generosity of Proculeius,
if his relation’s crime had been committed when he wrote3 but that chronologist takes
this allusion ss an agument that the ode was written between sanc. 729 and 732, and
from the tone of the allusion to Phraates he supposes ‚his restoration to have been recent,
md therefore assigno the ode to the year 730, in which Orelli and Dillenbr. agree
with him.

ARGUMENT.

Silver bath no beauty while hid in the earth, Sallustius, who desfiseet the ore till it is
polished by moderate use. Proculeius for his generosity ιο his brethreu will live for
ever, and the man who rules the spirit of avarice is a greater king than is from Carthage
ιο Gades were all his own. The dropsy· grows and grows till its cause is expelled.
Phraatesrestored 'to hiethrone is nothnppyg he only is a king and conqueror who
looks on money with indifference.
