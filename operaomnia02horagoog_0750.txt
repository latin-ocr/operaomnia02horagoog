writers, and by the poems aud fragments
that are extem under the name of Orpheus.
'rho name of Orpheus and the legenda re-
specting him are intimately connected with
the idea and the worship of a Dionysus
dwelling in the infernal regions (Ζαγρεὺς),
and the foundation of this worship (which
was connected with the Eleusinian mys·
tei-ies), together with the. composition ot
hymns and songs for its initiatione (τελεταὶ),
was the earliest function ascribed to him.
Nevertheleoe, under the influence of various
causes the fame of Orpheus grew so much
that he was considered as the first minstrel
of the heroic age, was made the companion
of the Argonauta, and the marvels which
music and poetry wrought on a rude and

394. Amphion, Thebanae conditor arcia]
This legend is mentioned in C. iii. ll. 2=
⁴⁸ Movit Amphion lapides canendo.” Itis
not noticed by Homer, who only knew
Cadmus as the founder of Thebes. ‘⁸ To
reconcile the conflicting pretensions of
Zethus and Amphion with those of Cadmus
as &undere of Thebes, Pausanias supposes
that the latter was the original settler of the
hill of the Cadmeia, while the two former
extendet! the settlement to the lower city
(ix. 5. 1—3)” (Grote, Hist. Gr. vi. p. 359,
n.). Plutarch (de Musioe, c. 3) mentions
that at Sicyon Amphion was looked upon
as the first composer of poetry and harp-
music.

He adds that small fragments of these laws,
insoeibed on wooden tames, called ἄξονες
or κύρβεις, were in existence in his day in
the Prytaneum.

400. divinis vatibus] Eumolpus, Orpheus,
Musaeus, Pamphus, Thamyris, are the prin-
cipa! names associated with the origin of
Grecian poeti-y, and they are all called
Thi-acian (see below, v. 405, n.). They are
called ⁴ divine,' not merely from the quality
of their art, but from their connexion with
the worship ot Apollo, Demeter, and Diony-
sus, whence above (v. 391) Orpheus is
called “ sacer interpresque deorum.”

402. Tyrtaeusque mares animos] Tyr·
tecue, as mentioned before (v. 75, n.), was
a native of Attica, and wrote in the elegiae
measure. He lest Attica and took up his
abode at Sparta during the second war be-
tween the Spartans aud Messenians, which
began mc. 685. “Exhortation to bravery
was the theme which the poet took for

natural and touching motives ” (Miiller, Ι
p. 112). There are three frag-ments, amount-
ing in the aggregate to upwards of a hun-
dred verses, which have a great deal of
vigour and feeling in them (7—9 Bergk)-
