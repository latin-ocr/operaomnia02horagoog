oARMINUM 1. 8. ’ 27

CARMEN VIII.

The principle of identification has led to sta-ange confusion and inventione respecting
the name assumed in this ode. 1 find from Estre that one scholar has affirmed, that by
Lydia Horace meent J ulia and by Sybaris Marcellus. The render has only to compare
the odeo in which this name occurs and he will form his own opinion. Here there is no
sign of jeelousy. bnt anxiety for the reputation of Sybaris; in C. i. 13 there is violent
jedousy of Telephum in iii. 9 there is a lover-’e coquetting and reconciliatiom while
in i. 25 Lydia is a worn-out prostituto looking for lovers who will not come. If we had

more of Ameon’s poetry to guide us„ we should probably see such traces of the origin
of all thoee odeo as would put the matter in its right light. The name of Sybaris is
obviously intended to represent the character into which the youth has fallen.

ARGUMENT-

Lydia, why art thou spoiling sybaris thus, so that he nhuns all manly exercises? He
who was onoe so active, why dooe he no longer ride, and ewim, and meeth, and
ὤιον the quoit and jevelin in the Campus Martius? Why does he hide himself with
thee, like Achilles, in woman's apparel?

erA, die, per omnes

Te deos oro, Sybarin cur properas amando
Perdere; cur apricum

Oderit campum patiens pulveris atque solis?
Gur neque militaris 5

Inter aequales equitat, Gallica nec lupatis
Temperat ora frenis? ’

Gur timet flavum Tiberim tangere? Gur olivum
Sanguine viperino

Cautius vitat, neque jam livida gestat armis 10
Brachia saepe disce,

Saepe trans finem jaculo nobilis expedito?
Quid latet, ut marinae

Filium dicunt Thetidis sub lacrimosa Trojae
Funera ne virilis 15

'Cultus in caedem et Lycias proriperet catervas?

2 properas] The reading of the MSS, including Bentley, nearly all have ⁴ pro.
is· proper-eu ’bnt the Scholiasta had‘ pro- peres‚' and some good MSS. have ⁴ equitet,’
Μ’ and Bentley hee said, 1 think truly, ‘temperet,' which are adopted by Lambi-
that the other reading probably arose out nus, Cruquius, ond othere. They were
of ⁸ oderit! But that word has an indica· etopped by ‘ timet,’ or they would probably
tivo oense, and 1 think the direct form ia have changed ‘vitat' and ‘gestat’ into tho
bedu throughout. The modern editors, subjunctive.
