680 HORATII FLACOI

Armenia. He might certainly even at that time have been called his ⁸ fidelis amicus ;' but
the words seem to imply a longer and more matured friendship3 and the epithet ⁸ clm-us?
which would have been mere flattery when Tiberius was twenty-two and had done nothing,
would suit him very well after his successes against the Raeti celebrated in C. iv. 14. In
A.u.c. 743, Tiberius was sent by Augustus against the Dalmatians and Pannonians, and
was absent from Rome four years, with the exception of a short interval, when he brought
home the remains of his brother Drusus, Α.σ.ο. 745. (Dion Cass. 54. 313 55. 2.)
Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 39) thinks that Florus accompanied him, and that this Epistle
was written the year of their departure, and published the next year, when he supposes
the letter to Augustus was written. This may be true, but Tiberius went with Augustus
to Gaul sanc. 738, and Florus may have been with him then. ΤῙιο objectiou to that
date is that Horace did certainly write verses about that time, of the kind Florus asked
ἴοις and though this is not conclusive, for he wrote with no great love for the taslt, on

the whole 1 think a later date is more probable.
Though there does not profess to be much substance in the Epistle, I think it the most

agreeable of all. 'rho stories in illustration are very well told3 the description of the
town and its annoyances has the force without the hsrshness of J uvena13 the vanity of
authors is ridiculed in a happy and humorous way, and the advice given them is good3
and though as usual the sermon at the end about money and philosophy is perhaps a little
tedious, and not very convincing, as a whole the Epistle is written in a popular style, and
the language and versification are easy and correct. It is always pleasant likewise to hear
Horace speaking of himself, the events of his life, aud the peculiaritiae of his character.
This Epistle furnishes materials for a considerable part of his biography, and makes us
acquainted with his peetical career in particular. It represents him as writing more from
necessity than out of love to poen-y, and it would not be difficolt to traee the force of a
pressure from without in many parts of his works.

ARGUMENT.

(v. 1.) Florus, if any one were to offer you a slave for sale, and say, ⁶ Here is a handsome
accomplished boy, you shall have him cheap= 1 have no wish to puff my property, and
am notobligedto partwith him3 but 1 assure you youwill find him abargainz no
dealer would give him you for the money, and there is no one but yourseli' 1 would
give him to so cbeapt but 1 must tell you he once shirked duty (as boys will), and
hld himself in the staircase,’—if you bought the boy you would do so with your eyes
open and at your own risk. You could not prosecute the man if your slave ran away
again.

(v. 20.) When you were going away I told you I was too lasy to answer your letters
when you should write. What was the use of my doing so ir now you are to repmach
me as ifI had broken my word?

(v. 26.) An officer of Lucullus' one night while he was aaleep had all his money and equip-
ments stolen. He became furious in consequence with himself as well as the enemy,
and while his blood was up stoi-med and took one of the king's suongest places fun of
treasure, for which he was promoted and rewarded. About the same time the general
wanted to get possession of a certain foi-trees, and calling the officer he saystohim,

‘Go, my brave friend, go where thy valour σιὼ thee, and great shall be thy reward!
‘ssNay replies the cunning man, ‘send some one who has lost his purae!
