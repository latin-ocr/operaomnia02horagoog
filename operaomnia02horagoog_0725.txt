1. Humano capiti] The picture 31111-
1103311 13 monstrous enough3 8 woman’s
113811 and 8 flsh's tan, with 8 110133’3 neck,
limbs from all manner of beate, 81111 feethers
from 811 30113 of birds. This portentous
medley (invented of 0011133 by himself, for
we 810 not bound to suppose he had ever
seen 8 pictor-inl monster of this kind),
Horace considered 8 30011 illustretion of
some of the poeti-y of 1113 day, in which
figures and 11118303 were thrown together
without order 01 purpose.

9. Pictor-ihm atque poe‘tt's] This is 8
supposed reply, that painters 81111 poets have
always been privileged people, which Ho-
1800 admits, but within certain limita. They
must not outrage common sense, nor should
they patch their verses with 11118333 which,
however pretty, have nothing to do with

the matter in hand.
18. flumen Rhenum] This is the same

form 83 “ Metaurum flumen'' (C. iv. 4. 38).

The Scholissts 811 83130111 saying this re·
fers ω 8 Greek proverb, μὴ τι καὶ εντα-
ρὶσσου ona„ the origin of which was 811
81131131· given by 8 11811 painter- to 8 ship-
wrecked 381101, who asked him for 8 piceno
of his wreck (see C. i. 6. 12, n.). The 111811
considered himself elever at drawing 8 cy-
111333, und 8311311 the 381101 if 113 should in·
troduce him 0110 111 1113 1111111113.
