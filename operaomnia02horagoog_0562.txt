by our proposition ¹ by ’ or ⁴ in the course
οῖ’ (L. (3. 1326, 9). It rather means
‘asten’ 1 think3 that ie, ‘de medio die’
means ‘after mid-day ς’ but it must note
proximity to mid-day, or it would have no
meaning at all.

covered it in a few of hia, which he calla
“ optimae notae.” Pottiem editing from
the Parni-n MSS„ hae ‘da,’ and gives no
various reading whatever. Several editione
of the sixteenth cen have ⁸ da‚' but the
earlier have ‘dic’ mm. Cruq. sayna
‘⁴ dic, ait Horatius? from which it ia Justly
infern-ed that he hed another reading, and
that ⁸ dic ’ ie hia glosa upon it. There ia
sufficient authority therefore for ⁸ da,' though
there ie much more for the other. Bentley
tays‘da’ isonlytheinterpolation of “pexus
needo quia magistellua,’ who found it iu
virgil (1³:01. i. 19), “ned tamen iate Deua
qui eit da, Tityre, nobisss' and therefore
thought Horace must have used the name
word. He ie au with the ⁴ ignotus
homuncio,' but ae the 88. have come to

the mear-'ng os thia word, ‘to put,' thia
application of it ia easily derived.

ὃ. iratum ventrem placata-it] Compare
8. 2. 13: “lauantem stomachum.” Both
passages put together suggest the idea of a

Tur-nipe, lettucee, radinhes, parenipe, with
picklee and sauma of various deecripfiona
(see S. ⁴. 73, n.), generally formed part of
the ⁴ gustus ' or ⁴ promulsis ’ which preceded
the ‘fercule'orcoureea ofwhich theregular
⁴ coena ’ consisted. The bour was killed,
the host (called ⁴ coenae pater ’ with a sort
of mock respect) infor-med hia guento, when
the south wind was not at ite worst, meau-
ing, 1 suppose, that when thia wind (⁴06-
rooeo') was blowing hard the meet would
soon spoil, if he had any meaning at all.
But it was probably some notion of his
own.

10. Hic ubi sublatis] The narrator ie
inclined to make a short buaineae of the
vianda, but he ie brought back to them
asterwnrde. The meat being removed (aud
though he only mentione one course here,
we may gather from what cornea proeently
that there was no lack of diehes, and there·
fore probably there were the usual comeo),
a slave, with hia clothes well tucked up,
‘succinctus' nee 8. 6. 107, n.), came and
wiped the ta le with a handeome purple
towel, and another gathered up whatever
had fallen or had been thrown on the floor,
which at the same time he etrewed with
saw-duat. perhaps eeented (see 8. ii. 4. 81).
The audente, eating with their fingere end
without platee, threw away the bones aud
other parta of their food that they did not
eat= such were “the cumba that fell from
the n'ch man’a table ” which Inar-us was
glad to pick up aud eat. ⁴ Gausape, -ie ⁹
(other {orme of which are ⁸ gausapa: ⁸ gau-

eloth of foreign manufactum. The table
was of maple wood, which wne not the
most costly (see S. 2. 4, n.), but not eo
