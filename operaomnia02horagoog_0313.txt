Marsis redibit vocibus:

fumes, such as even she, Canidia, had never
made. She knows that these are his
haunts, and wonders why 1101· drugs (which
she calls the druge of Medea, as imitating
those) take no effect upon him: when she
suddenly breaks out with the exclamation,
⁴⁴ Ah! ah! 1 see, some sti-onger spell is at
work; but 1 will find one that is stronger
than any.’' The greatest difficulty has been
made with vv. 69, 70, which are certainly
capable of various renderings. Orelli says
she had smeared the oouch he slept on with
drugs, to make him foi-get all women but
herself, taking ⁶ unctis ' with ‘oblivione.’
My own opinion is divided between this
interpretation and the following: ⁴ be is
sleeping on his drugged conch, in forgetful-
neas of all women,’ including herself, as if
she suddenly had seen him in that position.
1 incline on the whole to Orelli’s version.
Those who are not satisfied with either of
these interpretations will find a new one in
nearly every commentator they may con-
sult. The Scholiasts' notion that Canidia
was a seller of pei-fumes has a little·more
show of foundation (in v. 59, 60) than the
same as applied to Virgilius (C. iv. 12,
Introduction); 11111 11 15 111 all probability
derived from this only. Acron’s
reading, ⁴ suburbanae,’ in v. 58, shows the
cantion with which the Scholiasta are to 110
followed. In v. 60 the oldest MSS. vary
between ⁸ laborarint’ and ⁴ laborarunt? and
it is hard to decide between them. Both
have an appropriate sense: the one de-
claring that she never had wrought, and
the other that she never could have

wrought, such ointment. ⁴ Quale ⁹ is equiva-
lent to ⁴ cujusmodi.’ Τ110 8111111110, accord-
ing to Nan-dini (Rom. Ant. 111. 6, quoted by
Cramer, It. i. 369), was a 011001 leading
from the Esquiline to the Viminal. It was
one of the most populous and profligate
parts of the city. Propertius (iv. 7. 15)
describes it as the resort of thieves:
‘⁸ Jamne fibi exciderunt vigilacis furta
suburrae,
Et mea nocturnis trita fenestra dolis ‚³⁹⁹

and Martial of prostitutas (vi. 66) :—

⁴⁴ Famae non nimium bonae puellam
Quales in media sedent Suburra.”

One of the four ancient divisions of Rome
was called Suburana, 11111 this differed from
the later Subur-ra. which was not one of 1110
quar-tere formed by Augustus.
