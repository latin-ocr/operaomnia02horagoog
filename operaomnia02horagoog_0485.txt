460 HORATII FLAOGI

lissi-s teu us he wrote 220 books on the doctrines of that school. Damasippus cells him
(v. 286) “ sapientum octavus.'' His books, if he ever wrote them, heve not rescued him
from oblivion. Horace mentions him again in Epp. i. 12. 20 as the representative of
the sect. Esne suggests thet he may heve been the Stertinius mentioned by Quintilian
(iii. 1. 21) ss the author of s trestise on oratory, though, ss he ssys, the Stoice troubled
themselves less with rhetoric then with dialectie-

The discourse of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, thet every men in the world, high
or low, is med except the sege (see note on v. 46). Cicero has ergued the seme doen-ine
of the Stoi-s in his Pnredoxn (iii. ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων μαίνεται), but he does not go very
deep into the subject, or throw much light upon it.

ARGUMENT-

Yon write so seldom, end desti-oy what you heve written, und ere eng-ry with yourself
because you ure too luy to write eny thing worth speaking of. What do you mes-n
to do ? You seknowledge you cerne to this retreat ιο escape the noise of the Satur-
nalis. Well, then, begin ε let us heve something suited ιο γοαι· intentione. It's of no
use to find fault with your pens end beet the well. Where ere ull your promises ἓ
what heve you brought out ull your books for? Do you mesu ιο avoid odium by
shirking your duty? Men will only despise γοα for your peius. ”ris nothing but
eloth. Flee from the Siren, or be content ιο forfeit ell you heve eni-ned in better
days.

(v. 16.) Heeven reward you, Damasippus, with s barber for your good advice. But how
cume γοα ιο know me so well?

Since the usui-ers robbed me of all my money, 1 heve taken ιο meneging other people’s .
affairs. 1 used to be such n successful driver of burg-eins in ⁸11 sorts of property, that
people called me every where the werd of Men-cury.

1 sm ewen-e of thet. How did you get rid of thet menis? You seem, however, only ιο
heve exehnnged it for another, es a pain in the head is transferred ιο the stom-ch, or
es the patient ‘in s stupor suddenly falls to fighting his doctor. Only don’t follow his
example, end you moy heve it ell your own wey.

(v. 31.) My good friend, γοα need not deceive yourself. You, end all fools I may say,
ere med, if there be any truth in Stertinius, who saw me one dny es 1 was ready to
throw myself into the rivet-3 end “for shnme‚'' said he: ⁴⁴ why should γοα mind
being called med when ell are so? For what is mndnese? Folly end blind ignorswe
of the truth- All ere med from the highest to the lowest, except the vise. As in n
wide wood where all lose their wey, though ull go in different directions, so is it with
fools. One is afraid where there is no feei-3 another wsntonly rushes into danger,
end is dens to the voice of werning. You, Damasippus, heve s msdness for buying old
statues. But is the man who truste you less med? If 1 were to beg you to accept s
present from me, would you be med if you accepted it, or not rather med if γοα refused
your good luck? ⁸ This rescul, get what security you will from him, tie him fust in e
thousand knots, like Proteus he will still get out of them ς’ but, friend Petillius, if he
is med for mismeneging his affairs, γοα ere much more so for lending him money.

(v. 77.) “ Come listen to me, ye smbitious, ye avaricious, γε luxui-icus, ye superstitigus,
und 1 will prove you all ιο be med.

amount of his fortune engrnved upon his tomb. Why? Because he believed poverty
to be the greatest possible disgrsce3 end if he hed been dying sn as poorer, he would
