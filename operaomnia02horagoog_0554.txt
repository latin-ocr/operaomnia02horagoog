Etenim fateor me, dixerit ille,

Duci ventre levem, nasum nidore supinor,
Imbecillus, iners, si quid vis adde popino.

Tu, cum sis quod ego et fortassis nequior, ultro

Insectere velut melior verbisque decoris

Obvolvas vitium?

Quid, si me stultior ipso

Quingentis empto drachmis deprenderis? Aufer
Me vultu terrei-eg manum stomachumque teneto,

Dum quae Crispini docuit me janitor edo.

Te conjux aliena capit, meretricula Davum:
Peccat uter nostrum cruce dignius! Acris ubi me
Natura intendit, sub clara nuda lucerna
Quaecunque excepit turgentis verbera caudae,

Olunibus aut agitavit equum lasciva supinum,

50

Dimittit neque famosum neque sollicitum ne
Ditior aut formae melioris meiat eodem.
Tu cum projectis insignibuS, annulo equestri

‘Nidor' means ‘nidor culinae? as in Juv.
v. 162· “Cap tum te nidore suae putat ille
σιιιιιιιο;’ ’and Martis-l i. 93. 9. ‘Pasceris
et nigrae solo nidore οιιιιιιιο.” ‘Popiuo'
is not a common word. It means au idle
dissolute feno«, a stoquenter of‘ popinae:
cook- shops. (See above, S. 4. 62, ιι.) Sne-
tonius (de Illust. Gram. c. xv.) says that
Ianaeus, a teacher at Rome aud a freedman
of Pompeius Magnus. used to revile Sallust
the historiari, and agnmued him‘ ιῙιιιιιιιιιιιιι et
lurconum et nebulonem popinonemque”
(not ‘fganeonemque as Orelli has it).
Foroenini has only one other instance stom
a fragment of Varro. ‘'hi—ultro insec-
tsre,’ are you the man to come forward and
attack? that is, to be the first to do it.
See S. 6. 30, and C. iv. 4. 51, ιι.

reckoning the drachma and the denarius
as nearly the same value (about 83d.‚)
which was the case about this time,

thiswas a mall price, onlygiven for in-
ferior slaves. The price varied very widely
according to the beauty of the slaves (of
either sex), which enhanced their value
more than any else, or according to
their ednmflnn, or skill in ιιιιιᾱιοιιῐῒι, διο.

with an infinitive.1t expresses alarm aud
haste, for Davus sees his master frowning
and lifting his hand to striks him.
