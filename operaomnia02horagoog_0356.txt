SATIRARUM I. l.

Quid facias illi 3

331

J ubeas miserum esse libenter

Quatenus id facim ut quidam memoratur Athenis

Sordidus ac dives, populi comtemnere voees

65

Sic solitus : “ Populus me sibilat ; at mihi plaudo
Ipse domi simul ae nummos contemplor in arca.''
Tantalus a labris sitiens fugientia captat

Flumina . . . . Quid rides? mutato nomine de te

Fabula narratur: congestis undique saccis

Indoi-mis inhians et tamquam parcere sacris
Cogeris aut pictis Qquam gaudere tabellis,
Nescis quo valeat nummus3 quem praebeat usum?
Panis ematur, 01118, vini sextarius, adde

Quis humana sibi doleat natura negatis.

75

An vigilare metu exanimem, noctesque diesque
Formidare malos fures, incendia, servos

Ne te compilent fugienteS, hoc juvat?

Horum

Semper ego optarim pauperrimus esse bonorum.

62. tantu· qnantum habeas eia] This
would appear ω have been arather common
proverb. Lambinus quotes Plutarch (περὶ
φιλοπλουτίας), ταῦτα γάρ ἐστιν ἃ παραι-
νοῦσι καὶ διδάσκουσι· κέρδαινε καὶ φείδου

καὶ τοσούτου νόμιζε σαυτὸν ἄξιον ὅσον ἂν
ἔχῃς, which latter words Jacobs (Loet.

Ven. p. 383) has restored thus ss taken
from some comio poet :—

κέ datvs, φείδου, καὶ τοσούτου γ’ ἄξιον
ν μιζε σαυτὸν ....... ὅσον ἂν ἔχῃς.

He had better have left the last verse ss it
stands in Plutarch, for iix is ο complete
iambis line. Jsoobs also refers to Seneca
(Bp. 115. 14), “Ubique tanti quisque qusn-
tum habuit fuit,” which is taken from s
uugie poet of Greeoe. Two verses of
Lucilius are quoted by the Scholiast on
Juvenal, iii. 143 (⁴‘Quantum quisque sus
nummorum servat in πω Tantum habet et
fidei '’) 2— -

‘⁴ Aurum atque ambitio specimen virtutis
Τοιιιιιέιςέιθῶῗιὶἓιῒιιω ?) habens tentum ipse
sies tantique habearis.”

63. illi ?] ⁴ Such s man ns this ς’ but
Bentley. taking it to refer ω ‘ pars,’ reads
⁴ miseram ' on his ’own conjecture. Orelli
ἓἺίῗΣίἔὲἑ ῗοῗᾈίζῗέἓ Ῑῗᾶἓὲωηῖῗῗ 3323
‘sinoe,' not ⁸ quamdiu,' as Acron says aud
others following him. See C. iii. 24. 30.
The story that follows may hsve been picked

up by Horace at Athens or invenfed by him.
Aaron says it refers tao Timon, who hating
man retired to his money begs for conso-
lstion, which is nonsense, and not trum
but. Lambinus bns repeated it.

69. Quid rides ἵ] The miseris supposed
to lsugh nt Horsoe's trite musa-atina and
the solemn way it is announeed3 perhaps,
Orelli says, in imitation of some poet of the
day, but 1 think more likely from his own
head. ‘⁴ commendandum est hoc pronun-
tistione ’⁹ (Aci-eng. ‘⁴ venusta pronun-
tiatione expromen a est ” (ΡΜ-μὴ), which
sufficiontly explains the joke. This version
of the legend of Tantalus is the one now
muz-ent, taken from Homer (Odyss. xi. 582).
Pindsr (01. i. 57) sud other poets give n
different one, that a stone was kept always
hanging over sud threatening to fau upon
him. See Euripides, Orest- v. 5 ς Lueretius,
iii. 992, sq. See niso Epod. xvii. 66, n.

71. tanquam parcere saeris] This np-
peus to have been s proverbial expression.
Compare Isou-ates (Panath. c. 66): τῶν
μὲν γὰρ Ἑλλήνων πόλεων οὕτως αὐτοῖς
ἀπέχεσθαι σφόδρα δεδογμένον ἣν ὥσπερ
τοῖς εὐσεβέσι τῶν ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς ἀνακει-
μένων. See nlso S. ii. 3. 109, sq.: ‘⁴ Nes-
cius uti Compositis metuensque velut oon-
tingere secde ?’'

74. semar-iun] See v. 54, n. A ‘sex-
tarius ' of wine would be quite enough for
one temperate msn’s consumption in a day.

79. pauperrimus— bonorum] C. iii. 30.
ll, ‘⁶ Pauper aquae Daunus.” S. ii. 3. 142,
