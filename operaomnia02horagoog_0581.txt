rooms in the upper story of houses which
went by the name οἰ· insulae? the inhabit-
ants of which were called ‘coenacula-ii:

and they who kept them were said⁴ coena-
culariam exercere) In such a room Vitel-
lius lodged with his wife and children,
according to Suetonius (in vit. c. 7), and
Martial lived up three pair of stairs (i. 118)=

‘⁴ Scalis habito tribus sed altis.” Other
distinguished liter-ary men lived in gan-ets
then as they have since. Suetonius tells us
of Orbilius a celebrated grammarian, that
he was so lodgedz⁴ ‘namque jam persenex
pauperem se et habitare sub tegulisq uodsm
scripto fatetur-'⁹ (de illust. Gram. c. 9); and
Valerius Cato we leam from the same
munuc. ll)p assed the latter yearsofa

tonius quotes some bitter lines of Furius
Bibaculus (see S. i. 10, lixa), in which he
describes Cato ss ous—

⁴⁴ Quem tres cauliculi et selibra fan-is,
Racemi duo tegula sub uns,
Ad summam prope nutriant senectam.”

It seems to have been usual for annual

The Epignmi (xii. 32) begins—

(SceBelt. Gall. p. 6, ιι. Eng. Trans.) Ho-
race speaks of persons changing from
caprice and aping the ways of the rich.

presses the vulgar crastwhich the poor man
hires in imitation of the private yacht, as
smartly built and well found as a trireme,

boat, which he cannot afford to do, and

in S. ii. 7 (where see note on v. 23). and he

‘capillos curare’ was a common expression.
Domitian wrote a book ⁴ de ciira apilio-
rum, ’according to Suetonius (c. 18), which
he addressed to a friend who was bald
like himself. Orelli' s strange explanation
of the construction, making ‘inequali
tonsore' an ablativa absolute, has been
mentioned οιι C. i. 6. 2. ‘Subucula' was a
second tunic worn under the ⁴ intusium‚’
which was the upper tunic. ⁴ Pexae' signi·

shorn and was still fresh (pexusque toga·

tunic therefore would be new while the under
one was old and shsbby. The ‘'subucula
had sleeves, which the ‘intusium' had not.
Any difference therefore in the cloth would
bc very perceptible. Out of doors the
toga would conceal both, but in-doors
the toga was not worn. ‘’Intusium is
