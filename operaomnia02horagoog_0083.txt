CARMEN XXVI.

At the time this ode was written it would appear that the affairs of the Parthians were
occupying a good deal of attention at Rome, since Horace speaks of himself as the only
one who gave no heed to them. The circumstances that may be supposed to be referred
to are to be gathered from the following account. In the year A.u.0. 724, Phraates (see
Dict. Biog. Arsaces XV.) being on the Parthian throne, and having by his cruelties made
himself obnoxious to his subjecte, Tiridates, likewiso one of the family of Arsaddae,
was set up as a rival to Phraates, but was defeated in his attanpt to dethrone him, and
fied for protection that same year to Augustus, who was then in Syria, aster the death of
M. Antonius. (Dion Cass. li. 18.) Shortly afterwards, however, the Parthians sucoeeded in
getting rid of their king, and Tiridates was called to the throne. In Am c. 729, Phraates,
having obtained assistance from the Scythiam, returned and recovered hie kingdom3 and
Tiridates fled to Angustus once more for protection. He was then iu Spain. The fol·
lowing is J ustin's account (though professing to give a particular history of Parthian
affairs he does not refer to Tiridates· former ill success) ε Phraates, he says, elated with hia
success against M. Antonius, grew more cruel than ever, and in consequence ‘⁴ in exilium
a populo suo pellitur. Itaque cum magno tempore finitimas civitates ad posu-emuna
Scythas precibus fatigasset, Scytharum maximo auxilio in regnum restituitur. Hoc
absente regem Parthi Tiridatem quendam constituerant3 qui audito adventu Scytharum
cum magna amicorum manu ad Caesarem in Hispaniam bellum tunc temporis gerentem
profugit obsidem Caesari minimum filium Phraatis ferens quem negligentius custoditum
rapuerat. Quo cognito Phraates legatos statim ad Caesarem mittit, servum suum Tiri-
datem et filium remitti sibi postulat. Caesar et legatione Phraatis audita et Tiridatis
postulatis cognitis—neque Tiridatem dediturum se Parthis dixit neque adversus Parthos
Tiridati auxilia daturum. Ne tamen per omnia nihil a Caesare obtentum videretur
Phraati filium sine pretio remisit, et Tiridati quoad manere apud Romanos vellet opulen-
