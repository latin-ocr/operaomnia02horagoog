384 HORA'I'II FLAGOI

Musa, velim memores, et quo patre natus uterque

Contulerit lites, Messi clarum genus Osci;

Sarmenti domina exstat: ab his majoribus orti ⁵5
Ad pugnam venere. Prior Sarmentus : ‘⁶ Equi te

Esse feri similem dico.'' Ridemus, et ipse

Messius ‘⁶ Accipi0,” caput et movet. “ Ο, tua cornu

Ni foret exsecto frons,'' inquit, “ quid faceres, cum

Sic mutilus miniteris 3⁹⁹ At illi foeda cicatrix σο
Setosam laevi frontem turpaverat oris.

Campanum in morbum, in faciem permulta jocatuS,

Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa rogabat:

Nil illi larva aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis,

Multa Cicirrhus ad haec: Donasset jamne catenam 65
Ex voto Laribus, quaerebat; scriba quod esset,

Nihilo deterius dominae jus esse. Rogabat

Denique cur unquam fugisset, cui satis una

Farris libra foret gracili sic tamque pusillo,

Prorsus jucunde coenam produximus illam. 70

58. Accipio, caput et movet] ‘Messius
accepts Sarmentus’ joke as a challenge, and
ahakes his head fiercely at him, on which
Sarmentus takes him up and pretends to be

‚ alarmed. The wild horse to which Messius

is likened is the unicorn, an imaginary ani-
mal described by Pliny (N. H. viii. 21) ε
“ Asperrimam autem feram μονοεερὼτην,
reliquo corpore equo similem, capite cervo,
pedibus elephanto, cauda apro, mugitu

63? miniteris f] The MSS. and editions
are divided between this form and the indi-
cative. The subjunctive alone is right, and
1 have adopted it with Bentley and Ven.
1433. See Key's 1.. G. 1455, j.

63. Pastorem saltaret] Tbat he should
dance the Cyclops dance, in which the un-
couth gestures of Polyphemus courting Ga-
latea were represented. See Epp. ii. 2,
1252 “Nunc Satyrum nunc agrestem Cy
clopa movetur.” ovid (Trist. ii. 519) uses
⁰ salto ⁹ in the passive voice: ‘⁴ Et mea sunt
populo saltata poemata saepe-’⁹

65. Donassetjamne catenam] ‘⁸ Urbanius
haec dicta sunt in Sarmentum qui servilibus
erat natalibus, sumpta translatione a gene·

67. Nihilo datm-iu· The editions, till

Baxter (who. has ⁴ N· o ⁹), have ‘deterius

nihilo! Bentley says that all the oldoet
and best MSS. bave ⁴ nihilo deterius) He
adopts it, and so does Dillenbr. and Orelli,
⁸ nihilo ’ being pronounced aa a dissyllabis,
like “ vehemens et liquidus ” (Epp. ii. 2.
12⁰). Fea quotes a great many MSS. in
favour of the old readingg nevertheleaa 1
prefer Bentley's.
68. una Farris libra] The allowance οἱ
‘ far ⁹ to each slave was four or five ‘ modii ’
by the month, and it was aerved out to
them monthly, or sometimes daily (Epp. i.
14. 40). That allowauce would give three
ints a day, which Messius considers would
three times as much as Sarmentus could
possibly require3 ao he could not better
himself by running away. The ‘far’ was
otherwise called ‘ adoreum,’ and seems to
have been the same as the Greek ζειὰ or
ὅλυρα. The nature of this grain is not
exactly known. 'I'hat two persons above
the condition of slaves should be found in

- waiting on any man, great or otherwise, for

the purpose of entertaining him with such
low buffoonery as the above, seems sur.
prising to us; but we know that there was
τ aerumnarum ατς
would not demean themselves for the plea-
sure of a good dinner and the company of
the great. The entertainment of thoee per-
sons would serve to keep the conversation
from turning upon politica, which, as the
deputiea from both sides were now together,
it was desii-able to avoid.
