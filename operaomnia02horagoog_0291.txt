him. Nothing could be more natural or
suited to the occasion than the brief petitione
contained in the text as it stands.

49. Quaeque] The MSS. and editions are jesty

divided between ⁴ quique ’ and ‘ quaeque
in thia line, and ‘ imperet' and ‘impetret'
in the fifty-first. Cruquius' Scholiast reads
⁶ quaeque ’ and ‘impeti-eff explaining ‘vene-
ratur’ to mean ⁸ venerando precatur et
postulat! Thia is a common signification,
of which there are two instances in Horace
(S. ii. 2. 12⁴3 6. 8), and others elsewhere,
which will be found in Porcell. There mn
be little doubt 1 think that this Scholiast's
reading is correct, though the respectable
names of Doering aud Gesner, as well as
most of the older editors (Lambinus among
them), aud the Scholiasta Acron and Porss
phyrion, are ou the other side. In the
fifty-third line there is a curicus specimen
of Bentley's perverseneea, ir it be not an
oversight. He acknowledges that ⁸ manus
potentes ’ is the universal reading, and says
that he has no faint to find with it, though,
if he could get a single MS. of any antiquity
to support him, he would reed ⁴ manum
potentem,’ and apply it to Augustus. Aster
this we should expect to find him following
in the same tmck es his predecessore. But
not so. He edite according to his own pre-
ference ⁴ manum potentem!

51. bellante priam] The chorus prex
rather for the bleesings of peace then the
triumphs of war, and therefore say that
Augustus' clemency to bis conquered ene-
mies makes him greater than hia prowess in
subduing them, according to Anchises’
wurning (Aen. vi. 852), in which virgil
plainly had reference to Augustus :—

“ Tu regere imperio populos, Rome,
Hzeffliintd'rdnt artes, pacisque imponere
morem,

Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.”

54. Albanae—securem] The Roman
finces. as “Albaniquepatres” (Aen. i. 7).
55. responsa] Replies to their offers of

submissiora aud pofifiom ἴω friendship.
This word is used for the replies of the
gods, and here perhaps expresses the ma·
of Augu-tu· deliret-ing hie will as that
of a god, like Vin-gil (Ecl. i. 45): ‘⁴ Hic mihi
responsum primus dedit ille petenti.” But
‘responsum’ isalsoa technicaltermfor the
answer of a jurisconsult to a client, or a
{Experior to an {ufer-ior, as of the emperor to

5⁶5? Jam Fideeprgt Pax] This group
occure nearly in the same combination in
C. i. 24. 6. The figures are variously re-
presented on medels, διο. ⁴ Fides,' which
represents honeety, good faith,and is called
in the above place ⁴ justitiae soror,’ appears
on a medal of Vespasian as a metron with
long robe, very erect figure, holding out a
‘ patera ’ in her right hand, and carrying a
‘ cornu copiae ’ in the other. ‘ Pax ’ usually
carries a caduceue und olive-branch in one
hand, and sometimes corn in the other.
¹ Honos,’ which has nothing to do with
what we call honour in the sense of honesty
(‘ fides '), but represents Gloria in her good
character (sor she hed a bad, aa vain glory,
C. i. 18. 16), is exhibited on the reverse of
amedal ofTitusasa man admcedin

he is side by side ffivm, whose natural
companion he is. For Virtus ia most usually
represented in a military character as Forti-
tudo, a female figure with a helmet and a
spear, and with her foot like that of Honos
testing on a globe. But, though these types
symbolically represented Virtus, the name
embraced all moral eourage and stedfaet·
