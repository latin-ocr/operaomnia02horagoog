it to mean a sti-ain os lament. l-Ie considers
the word to be of Asiatic origin, being
bormwed by the Ionic poets of Asia Minor
from their neighbours. The dates above
assigned to these early poete are later than
§me have given them. 1 have followed
iiller.

79. Archilochum proprio rabies] See
Epp. i. 19. 23, n.; Epod. vi. 13. “It is
vain ιο seek an etymology for the word Iam·
bus ι the most probable suppositionis that
it orig-insted in exclamations, ὀλολυγμοὶ,
expressive of joy. Similar in form are
θρίαμβος, the Bacchic festival processiom
διθύραμβος, a Bacchic hymn ς and ἴθυμβος,
also a kind of Baccbic song ” (Miiller, p.
133). The word, according to this writer,
‘⁸ originally denoted nothing but the jest
and banterused at the festivals of Demeter,'’
of whose worship Paros, the birth-place of
Archilochus, was next to Eleusis the prin-
cipal seat. From these festivals therefore,
the soenes of unrestrained raillery and scur-
rilous jesting‚ Archilochus may be supposed
to have conceived his iambico. The iambic
trimeter is said to have been invented by him
(Plutarch de Musica, c. 28), and likewise the
uochaic tetrameter, and other measures par-
ticularly described by Miiller. Of the two
first he says ε ‘⁴ Tbese metros were in their
:2:¹3 gnsshffissshx‘ssdsst222205.⁶ffizk.332
of the Olympio Jupiter. Nor can there be
any stmnger proof of their perfectiori than
that metroe said to have been invented by
Archilochus retained their currency through
all ages of Greek poetry; and that although
their application varied in many ways, no
material improvement was made in their
structure ’⁹ (p. 136). sse principal Iambic
writers who followed Archilochus were
Simonides of Amorgus, a younger contem-
porei-{⁴05 Solon, and Hipponax of Ephesus

( 80. Halm· cocci cepere pedem] In re-
spect to ‘soccus’ aud ‘cothurnus,’ ss the
characteristica of comedy and tragedy, see

Epp. ii. 1. 174, n. The metre most used
in the dialogus of the earliest Greek trage-
dies was the trochaic tetrameter, which metre
is used in many poesages of the Persae of
Aeschylus. But the iambic trimeter appears
to have been used by Pbrynichus. Aristotle
(Post. iv. 19) calls it μάλιστα λεκτικὸν τῶν
μέτρων, and comparing it with the Epic he
says (Rhet. iii. 8. 4)= τῶν δὲ ῥυθμῶν ὁ
μὲν ὴρῶος σεμνὸς rai λεκτικὸς καὶ ἁρμο-
vn'ac' δεόμενος, ὁ δ’ ἴαμβος αὐτ-ἡ ἐστιν ἡ
λέξις ὴ τῶν πολλῶν· διὸ μάλιστα πάντων
τῶν μέτρων ἰαμβεῖα φθέγγονται λέγοντες.
Horace’s ⁴ natum rebus agendis ' appears
also to be an echo of Aristotle's πρακτικόν
in the following passage (Ροὲι. 24. lo): τὸ
ἰαμβικὸν καὶ τετράμετρον κινητικά, τὸ
μὲν ὀρχηστικόν, τὸ δὲ πρακτικόν. Πρακτι-
κόν means that the metre suits the language
of action. By ‘ alternis sermonibus ⁹ Horace
means dialogue generally3 not those'dis-
logues in which verse answers to verse,
στιχομυθία. When he says that the iam-
bic overcomes the noise of the theatre, it
may be that he refers to the clear intona-
tion which that mette admits of, or to its
engaging the popular attention from its
adaptation to the understsndings of all. As
to the modificatione of the Iambic metre in
the hands of the three principal tragedians,
see Miiller, Lit. Gr. v. i. p. 317. Thes same
writer has some remarks on the adaptation
of the iambic trimeter to comedy, the cor-
rectn3ss of which may be disputed (v. ii.
p 83. Musa dedit fidibus] On the con-
nexion of with music and danciug,
and on Greek music in general, Miiller’s
History of Greek Literature (i. 148, sqq.)
may be oensulted with advantage. The
earliest stringed instrument was the tetra·
chord or four-stringed cithara, which was
improved by Terpander, by the addition
of three stringe forming the heptachord.
Though the flute (⁴ tibia ') came very early
into use as an aecompaniment to lyric
poetry, it has always retained the name it
originally derived from the lyre. The dc-
scription of Horace includes the choral lyric
