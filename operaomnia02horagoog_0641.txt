Rure ego viventem, tu dicis in urbe beatum;

HORATII FLAGGI

Oui placet alterius sua nimirum est odio sore.
Stultus uterque locum immeritum causatur inique ε
In eulpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam.

Tu mediastinus tacita prece rura petebas,

Nunc urbem et ludos et balnea villicus optas3

Me constare mihi scis, et discedere tristem
Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam.
Non eadem miramur ; eo disconvenit inter
Meque et te: nam quae deserta et inhospita tesca

Credis amoena vocat mecum qui sentit, et odit

Quae tu pulchra putas. Fornix tibi et uncta popina
Incutiunt urbis desiderium, vide0‚ et quod
Angulus iste feret piper et thus ocius uva,

chariots remained till the rece ns ready to
begin. They were then brought out and
ranged side by side behind a rope called
⁴ alba lines ' or ‘cslx,’ which was stretched
across the course and formed a ban-ier,
beyond which the chariots could not ad·
vnnce till the signal wss given and the rope
withdrawn. It is from this obstruction or
stom the ⁴ carceres ' that the metaphor in
the text is taken.

14. Tu mediastinus] See Becker's Gall.
Exc- on the ‘ Slsve Family! He had been
one of the lowest slsves, used for all manner
of work in the ¹ familis urbans‚’ and by his
pitiful countennnee (for he was afraid per-
haps to speak) had shown how much he
wished to be delivered from thst condition
and to be sent to work on the farm, though
thot was generally considered to be the
grestest punishment (see S. ii. 7. 118, n.).
When there he had risen it may be sup-
posed to be ⁴ villicus,' ferit is not likely a
⁴ mediastinus ' from the town would be sud·
denly promoted to be stewsrd of the farm.
Thst was the name sor the lowest sort of
slave both in the town and country este-
blishment. It is derived, Forcellini says,
from ⁴ medius,' from his standing in the
midst end being at every one’s csll. The
Scholiasta derivo the word from ἄστυ, be·
esuse he lived in the middle of the city,
which is nonsense. Porphyrion, on this

and Priscisn, quoted by For-collini and Bee-
ker (ubi sup), limits the name to the bath·
ing slaves. He is corrected by Nonius (ii.
573, ap. Forcell.); but it is probable thot
the ⁸ balneatores ⁹ were included in the clam
of slaves called ⁴ mediastini?

19. tesca] Acron says ‘tenes’ (or ‘tes-
qus‚' ss it is in Ascensius’ edition of his
text and Porphyrion’s, and so it eppe-rs in
Comm. Cruq.) are “locs deserta et diffi-
cilis,” and that it is a Sabine word. Ae·
cording to the suthon-iiis· quoted by Festus
it signiiied slso a consecrated enclosure, snd
Varro says much the same (de Ling. Ins. Β.
2). He derives the word from ⁸ tueor,' be-
cause therein the myster-ies of the gods vere
obser-ved (⁴¹:11entnr ¹). There are others,
according to For-cell„ who believe the word
to be derived from the Greek δασῦσειος
(δασύς and σκιά). There is little prob-e
bility in either of these etymologies. Ac-
cius used the word before Horace, ond
Lucan after him (vi. 41) ε ‘⁴ Amplexus fines,
