60. Quid proderat ditasse] ⁴ What good
then did 1 get by spending money upon the
old Peligniau witches (i. e. to teach me my
aeft), and mingling for thee a more quick
and potent draught? But, though it be
31:23⁴& ⁹352}le ffl5⁸3oe3303s30ffi
have it! There is another reading, ⁴ Quid
proderit’ and ⁴ Si tardiora,' supported by
good MSS„ and the first of the two by the
authority of Porphyrion, who says the sense
is uncertain3 but he inclines to render it
thus: ⁴ What will it profit thee to have paid
the witches for antidotes more ‘jaid‘ aud
power-ful than my chartus ? But, διο. He

ad the reading ⁴ sed! 1 am not aware that
⁴ proderat ’ appears in any edition before
Bentley's3 but it has good MS, authority,
and if the witeh be speaking of herself the
imperfect is preferable with ⁴ sed) Fea re-
tains ⁴ proderit ⁹ aud ⁴ si,’ and makes ⁴ votis '
the witch’s prayers. ⁴ What will it profit
me . . . . if a death awaits thee slower than
1 would have it ? ' For that sense we
should have ⁴ maneant! The old editions,
Ven. and Asceusius', follow the Scholiast in
reading ⁴ sed? Lambinus and the editors
of his day have ⁴ si! 1 prefer the reading
and interpretation 1 have given, which is
that of Bentley and Orelli, and now of
Diuenbr„ who has been converted. ⁴ In hoc,’

64. laboribue.] The MSS. vary between
⁴ laboribus ⁹ and ⁴ doloribus! The former
is the sti-unger word of the two, and was
pzobagly thzcrgadipg of tilae Scholiasta, ge
o wom q expmns ‘suppe ’
⁴⁴ sufficias ad novos dolores et labores per-

ferendos et poenas.” ⁴ Labores ’ is the
word elsewhere used for the punishment of
Tantalus (C. ii. 13. 28), and 1 think it has
been properly restored to the text. Ascen-
sius has it, but none 1 believe between him
and Bentley. ⁴ Infidus ¹ and ⁴ infidi ' both
have support fmm the MSS. But the
latter has the best, according to Torrentius,
Bentley, and Orelli. Fea’s references 1
cannot follow, but he reads ⁴ infidus! The
old editions have ⁴ infidus,’ and 1 know of
none but Torrentius' that has ⁴ infidi’ till
Bentley's. As father and son each ear-ned
the epithet, it is not easy to judge in this
conflict of authority to which of them it
should be given. Tho poets of the Augustan
age, in relating the punishment of Tantalus,
refer only to that legend accordingto which,
standing in the midst of water, with fruit·
trees over his head (⁴ benigna dapes ⁹), he is
not able to reach either. The other story,
followed by Pindar and the Greek poets, of
a great stone suspended over his head and
ever threatening to fall on him, the Roman
poets do not allude to. But Cicero does,
and ouly to that de Fin. i. 183 Tusc. Disp.
iv. 16). In the barini Palace at Rome
there is a rilievo containing a very striking
group of the three suffer-ers, Ixion, Sisyphus,
and Tantalus, in which the last is repre-
sented with a stream of water pouriug from
his hands, which are joined aud raised to
his mouth. The expression of pain and
disappointment approaching to despair is
admirably represented, to judge by the en-
graving given by Speuce. In the same
group Sisyphus is represented as carrying a
hage stone on his shoulders up a steep
mountain, which seems to agree with Ovid's
expression: ⁴⁴ Aeoliden saxum grave Sisy-
phon urget '' (Met. xiii. 26). There is how-
ever but one story about Sisyphus' punish-
