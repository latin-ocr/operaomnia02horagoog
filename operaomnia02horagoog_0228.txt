pre-eminent among critics, objects ιο ⁴ ex-

See what Euripides says (Bacch. 682),
εὗδον δὲ πᾶσαι σώμασιν παρειμέναι there-
fore‘ Edonisst not ⁸ exsomnis, is what
Horace wrote. But if they sometimes sleep
they probably sometimes are kept awake,
and so Horace represents one of them here?
And‘ exsomnis' is not the mere ornamen-
tal epithet Bentley would make ita appear,
but highly desa-iptive, which ‘Edonis' is
not, nor is it wanted at all. -For‘ ut mihi’
Bentley reads‘ ac‚' which has some MS.
authority, though not much apparently.
Horace has‘ aeque ut' (C. i. 16. 7-9),
and other writers have ‘pariter ut,' ‘non
minus ut' (Prop. i. 15. 7), ‘perinde nt,'
which are not the same certainly as‘ non
secus ut! Of this there seems to be no other
instance, but I believe‘ ut’ ιο be the read-
ing here and to be used in preference ιο
⁴ ac,’ because that word occurs in the line
before. Some would put a full stop before
‘ut‚ ' and make it a particle of exclamation.
The Scholiasta did not understand it so.

For‘ Ο Lenaee, sequi deumss Bentley pro-
poses ‘,Te Lenaee, sequi ducem? saying
there is ambiguity iu the sentence as it
stands, as ιο whether‘ cingentem' applies
to the follower or the god. But the ambi·
guity is not removed by his emendation,
aud Horace sufficieutly explains his own
meaning in C. iv. 8. 33: “Ornatus viridi
tempora pampino Liber.”

GARMEN XXVI.

This ode represents a successful gallant's first reflisal, and his mortification and wrath
at his defeat. To apply it to Horace, οι· ιο assume from the opening, as Franke does

(following the Scholiasta) that he was getting into years, and about ιο abendon lyric poeta-y,
01· that Chloe is ‘⁸ illa haud dubie de qua i. 233 iii. 9. 9,'’ or any other Chloe whatever,

is to mistake the character and scope of the ode, in my opinion. 1f any of Horace's
compositione are purely fanciful, this may be pronounced ιο be so.
