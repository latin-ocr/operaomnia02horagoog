HORATII FLAGOI

“ Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum.”
Quid dignum tanto feret hie promissor hiatu?
Parturiunt monteS‚ nascetur ridiculus mue.

Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur inepte: .

“ Die mihi, Musa, virum captae post tempora Trojae
Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbeS.''

N on fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem
Cogitat, ut speciosa dehine miracula promat,

Antiphaten Scyllamque et cum Cyclope Charybdin.

Nee reditum Diomedis ab interitu Meleagri,

braced the birth of Helen the daughter of
Zeus and Nemesis (not Leda), the judg-
ment os Paris, the abduction of Helen, the
sacrifice of Iphigenia, and the events of the
first nine years of the war. Of the other
poenis one was the Νόστοι by Agias οἰ
Troezene, on the return of the Grecian
commandere from Troy, the wanderings of
Menelaus, the murder of Agamemnon, and
the revenge of Orestes. Another was the
Τηλεγονὶα of Eugammon of Cyrene, which
continued the history of Ulysses till his
death by the hand of his son Telegonus.
The Thebais and Epigoni, relating the con-
tests between Argos and Thebes, are also
included in the, Cyclic poenis, but their
authors are unknown. (See sor more par-
ticulare Miiller's Hist. of Gr. Lit. c. 6.)
There was a later Epic poem called Thebais,
the author of which was Antimachus of
Claros, a contemporary of Plato. Porphy-
rion (on v. 1⁴6) calls him a Cyclie poet,
from the subject of his poem, the extent of
which was such, he says, that he had filled
tvoent -four volumes (that is, twenty-four
books before the armament arrived at
Thebes (see note on the above verse). The
poem notwithstanding seems to have been
much admired.

139. Par-luriunt montem] The reading
of the old editions and many MSS„ ⁴ par-
turient,’ is undoubtedly wrong. Verba
ending in ⁴ urio ' signify purpose or desire,
and ⁴ parturio ’ has the same relation to
⁴ pario ' that ⁴ esurio ' has to ⁴ edo,’ meaning
the effert or desire to bring forth, the being
in labour. Porphyrion quotes the proverb
on which this and the fable that Phaedrus
has imitated (iv. 22) of the mountain in
labour, are founded: ὤδινεν οὖρος εἶτα μῦν
tiniarum, which in Athenaeus (xiv. 6) is
quoted a little differently: ὤδινεν ὅρος,
Ζεὺς δ’ ἐφοβεῖτο, τὸ δ’ ἔτεκεν μῦν.

143. Non fimum ea· ,βάρου-ε]
says of Homer that he does not hegin with
a flash which ends in smoke, but with him
out. of smoke comes a bright light3 that ie,
out of a modest beginning the mdes· is led
on to heauties and objecta of intes-esu and
he is carried rapidly forward instead of
being detained over matters preliminary and
irrelevant. It is obvious that ‘fumo ⁹ in
the second clause is out of place, and is
onl used to maintain a verbd antithesin
an the beauties selected (‘ speciosa mira-
cula,' ⁶ striking marvels ') are not the most
striking. Horace seems always to fall short
of his subject when he speaks os Homer.

145. Antiphaten Scyllamque] These
are all stories from the Odyssey. Anti-
phates was king of the Laestrygones, a
eesffnffifflmffi
ships (x 80, sqq.). The adventure with
Polyphemus the Cyclops forms the leading
event of the ninth book. The description
of Scylla and Charybdis is contained in the
twelflzh book (vv. 85, sqq.).

146. Nec reditum Remedia] This was
related in the cyclic poem called Νόστοι
above mentioned. Meleager, who was one
of the Argonauta, and was still more &mous
for the destruction of the boar sent by
Diana to vex the inhabitants of Calydon in
Aetolia, was uncle to Diomed, being hmtheoe
to Tydeus. -The cause of his death is
variously related. According to Homer he
was cursed by his mother Althaea for the
slaughter of her twu brothers (11. ix. 567,
sqq.), and her Erinnys pursued him to his
