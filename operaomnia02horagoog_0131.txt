106 HORATII FLAOOI

ARG UMENT.

The way to live, Licinius, is neither rashly to tempt nor cownrdly to fear the stoi-m. The
golden mean secures a man at once from the pinching of poverty and the envy of
wealth. The lostiest obJects fall soonest and most henvily. In adversity or prosperity
the wine man looks for change. Stoi-ms come and go. Bad times will not always be

bad. Apollo handles the lyre as well as the bow. In adver-city show thyeelf bruc,

in prosperity take in nil.

Rncrrms viveS, Licini, neque altum
Semper urgendo neque, dum procellas
Cautus horresciS‚ nimium premendo

Litus iniquum.

Auream quisquis mediocritatem 5
Diligit tutus caret obsoleti
sordibus tecti, caret invidenda

Sobrius aula.

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens

Pinus et celsae graviore casu

ὅ. Horace’ s e comes near to that
of Aristode (Polit.iv.12)‚aeai σώζον-
ται δ’ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν ουτοι (ol μέσοι)
μάλιστα τῶν πολιτῶν· οὔτε γὰρ αὐτοὶ τῶν
ἀλλοτρίων ὥσπερ οἱ πένητες ἐπιθυμοῦσιν
οὕτε τῆς τούτων ἕτεροι. Aristone quotes
a maxim of Phoqylides to the same effect,
πολλὰ μέσοισι ν ἄριστα· μέσος θέλω ἐν πό-
λει εἶναι. That every virtue is a mean
between two vices ia a doctrine laid down
in the Ethics of this author (Nic. Eth. ii.
7), and Cicero (de off. i. 25) says,⁴ ι-Νιιιι

iratus qui accedit ad poenam me-
diocritatetn inam tenebit quae eet inter
nimium et parum?

6. obcoleti] That which has gone out
of use· therefore old and deceyed. For
the various applicatione of the word see
Foroeu.

9. Saepius] Burmann' s conjecture (on
Ovid, Heroid. xiv. 39), ‘saeviuel is
strongly defended by Jani, who thinks

‘saepius 'much too weak, especially for so
elaborate a poem. Sanadon adopts ⁴ sae-
viuu’ ns :meing better with ‘graviore
oeeuss which, he says, would have been

‘frequentiore cesu’ had the true reading
been‘ saepius. ' Dacier ιε opposed to him,
and eo ure all the MSS„ the Scholiasta,
and every edition earlier than the eighteenth
century (Burmann edite ⁴ saepiu· ’), and all

the editors of this except Fen. Cunningham

Bentl’ey carries the sysytem of cori-ecfingyon

aestheticnl principles far enough. The

same editors follow one another in reading
‘excelsae ’ for ⁴ et celsae!

The illustratione used in this muza are
frequently met with. A passage of Lucre·
tius' fifth book (1116 -1133) may be com-
pared with thia ode. In the εἰκώ book
(v. 421), eq.) he aska.

“Altaque cur plerumque petit locu, plurima
Mq‘ffiissassjin summis vestigia cernimus
The :fide-et passage containing this illustra-
tion is one of Herodotus (vii. 10), ὁρᾷς τὰ
ὑπερέχοντα ζῶα ὡς κεραυνοῖ ὀ θεὸς οὐδὲ
ἑᾷ φαντάζεσθαι, τὰ δὲ σμικρὰ οὐδέν μιν
κνίζει· ὁρᾷς δὲ’ υς ἐς οἰκῆματα τὰ μέγιστα
αἰεὶ και ὄενδρ ra τὰ τοιαῦτ’ ἀποσκήπτει τὰ
βέλεα· φιλέει γὰρ ὁ θεὸς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα
πάντα κολούειν. Of later writers Ovid
say· (Rern. Am. 369),
“Summa ‘petit livor, perflant altissima
