Ac bene nummatum decorat Suadela Venusque.

‘talenta' see S. ii. 7. Simu.

On
⁴ Rotundo ’ is
not used in this sense elsewhere. Petronius
uses ⁸ corrotundo,' and the meaning is the
same aa ours when we talk os a round
number: it is a complete number, leaving
out fractione. ⁴ Porro ' means ⁴ fai-ther!
⁴ Quadrat acervum‚’ ⁸ makes the fourth side
of the square,’ as it were.

Nondum habitas, nullas nummorum erexi-
mus aras '' (i. 113).

Arnobius, writing with the zeal of a cate-
chumen, says: ‘⁸ Quis ad extremum deam
Pecuniam esse credat? quam velut maxi-
mum numen vestm indicant literae donare
annulos aureos, loca in ludis atque in spec-
taculis prima. amplitudinem πιιειςίείειιιιιε,υ
διο. (contra Gentes, lib. 4, p. 12⁶.) Au·
gustine (de civitate Dei, iv. 21 , and else-
where) speaks os Pecunia as a goddess
worshipped by the Romans3 but there is
no foundation for this as a litei-al fact.
Mammon was not more worshipped at Rome
than it is among ourselves. Horace here
repeaoe in effect what he said in S. ii. 3.

‘ Suadela ' is another form of Suada, who
represented the Greek divinity Πειθώ, Per-
suasion. The name, Cicero tells us, was
latinized by Ennius (Brut. 15 . Πειθώ was
usually associated with ’Δφρο ‘'v-21, and their
statues stood together at Athens, where it is

separate worship at Rome. She was sup·

to assist Venus in presiding at mar-
tinges, and she, the Graece, and Mei-cury
were the acknowledged companions of that

goddess. Therefore Horace assodatee them
here. Cicero tells us that Ennius called
the eloquent M. Cethegus “Suadae me-
dullam’ (Cat. Maj. xiv. 50), ⁴ the marmu-
οἰ persuasionss (See Epp. ii. 2. 117, n.)

kings from a very earlyperiod. Aust off
them is given by clinum (1³¹. H. vol. iii.
p. 430, Append.). The last was Archelaus.
who was appointed by Μ. Antonius A.u.c.
718, Ariarathes vll„ who represented the
lineal kings os Cappadocia, having been
deposed and put to death. Archelaus was
king at the time this epistle was written,
aud he reigned fifty years. At his death
(anuc- 770) Cappadocia was reduced to the
form of a Roman province, in the third year
of Tiberius (Tacitus, Anu. ii. 42). He had
lands and slaves on them, and property of
that sort, but wanted the precious metal.
Ariobarzanes, who was king of Cappadocia
when Cicero was governor of Cilicia, ia
described by him as “rex perpaupoe” (ad
Att. vi. 3). “Nullum aerarium, nullum
vectigal habet. Nihil illo regno spoliatins
nihil rege egentius” (vi. 1). Μ. Brutus had
advanced him large sums of money at ex·
orbitant interest, which he was unable to
pay, and Cicero, though he got loo talenta
from him, was unable to exn-actall the deht-
Cn. Pompeius too was his meditor, and all
he could getvas a promissos-y bond for 2⁰⁰
talenta payable in six months (vi. 3). Ho-

L. Licinius Lucullus began his public life
under Sulla, and assisted in checking m·
thridates and bringing him to terma, and,
when the war with that king broke out again
aster Sulla's death, was appointed to the
conduct os it, being at the time pro—consul
iu Cilicia. His extraordinary successes
against Mithridates and Tigranes, king of
Armenia, are related by Plumch in his
life of Lucullus. He was prevented {rom
completing his work by the intr-ignes of
his enemies and the mutinies of his army,
