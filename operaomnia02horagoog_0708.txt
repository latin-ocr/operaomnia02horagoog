EPISTOLARUM 11. 2.

Nemo hoc mangonum faceret tibi; non temere a me
Quivis ferret idem. Semel hic cessavit et, ut fit,

In scalis latuit metuens pendentis habenae.

13. Nemo hoc memsam-et mis]
He professes to deal as a friend. The
⁸ mangones ’ were slave-dedere, a class in
no favour but osten very rich. The prin-
m'pnl person in this line of business in
Augustns’ time was one Thoranius (Suet.
Aug .c. 69). The nsme is derived from the
Greek μὰγγανον, narraverim, to juggle,
chent. They were distinguished from‘ mer·
catoresss being mlled‘ venalicia-iil Hence
in Plautus (Trin. ii. 2. 53, sq.) we have—

“Pa Quid is, e? Lr. Eget. Pa.
Habuitne rem ? ΙΝ. Habuit.
Pu. Qui enm perdidit?
Mercaturamne sn venales habuit, ubi rem
perdidit ?”
where‘ venales' mesns‘ servos! (See Dig.
50, tit. 16, 5207, quotedinDict. Ant„ art.
Servus) The wey of ‘raising’ slaves
for the msrket and selling them differ-ed
but little from the practice in modern
times.

14. Semel laic cenavit] He once wss
behind his time, and hid himself under or
on the staircase for seer of e flogging.

‘'Cessator and‘ erm' were synonymous
words. (SeeS. ii. 7. 100. 113 ιι) The
suits my have been dark sometimes, and,
as in most houses the principal accommo-
dation was on the ground floor, it is pro-
bable that so much regnrd was not had to
the lighting of the stsiroese as we pay now.
einero, speaking of Clodius (pro Mil. c.
15), ssys: ‘⁴ cum se ille in scalarum late-
bras abdidisset,” Milo might have fairly
put him to death3 and again of the same

- person in another speech (Philipp. ii. Ω) he

says M. Antonius would have killed him,
“nisi ille se in scalas tabernae librariae
emicasse& It appears a whip was hung
apin some conspicuous place in terrorem.

Comm. Crnq. ssys it hung in the middle of
the house, and that slaves were tied to the
stairs to be flogged.

16. Der nummum] This line Orelli gives
to Horace. 1 think it is the conclusion of
the dealer’s’ speech, but this is doubtful.

17. poenae εει-τιναῆ] Among the faults
the seller of ι slave was bound to tell was
running away. (See passages from Cicero
and the Digest quoted on S. ii. 3. 285.)

21. ne mea saevus Juryaree] * Mea '
belongs ιο* epistola, ' and is along way out
of its place. J urgo 'which Varro derives
from⁸ jure agoss is used as a forensia word
hythe law writers. It is intransitive. (See
Forcell.) The reading of the best MSS.
and the editions of the fifteenth century is

‘rediret.' Later editions, including Bentley,
have ‘veniret,’ which also has MS.a au-
thority. Orelli, Dillenburger, Pottier, and
some others of the latest editors, heve gone
back to the old rading. It is not easy to
understand how ‘ rediret' should have got
into such MSS. ss the four Blandinian, the
Berne, and Parisiau, is * veniret ⁹ were the
true reading.- Nenrly all Torrentius' MSS.
had‘ rediret? and he approves, but does
not edit, that reading. His text and his
notes ere constnntly at vai-ianoe, and on this
account he is often quoted as an authority
for readings he doesq not approve. As his
judgment was good, this is to be regretted.
In this instance it is not easy to say which
is the right word, but 1 prefer following the
better order of MSS. Florus hed written
probably more than once, expostulah‘ng
with him on his silence, and had got no
answer. .

24. Sa· tamen attentas 0⁹] This word
Porcellini esplains‘ ‘labefactare et con-
vellere conaris· 'and he quotes Dig. xii. 6,
