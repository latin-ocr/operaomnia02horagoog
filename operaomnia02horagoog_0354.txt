great for a man who has 8 selfish purpose
to serve, it he has set his henrt upon it.
The second person is used to give force to
the language. The sels-deceiver is con·
fronted with his own illustration.

42. Furtim] Heindorf and Orelli say
this belongs only to 4 defossa? I rather doubt
it. 4 Defosse deponere terre ' cannot be
taken too closely together, as Dillenbr.
justly remarks.

43. Quod ei comminuas] The miser is
supposed to inter-rupt, and say, 44 but if
you were to take from it, it would soon
dwindle to 8 palti-y 4 as.' '¹ Bentley end
others put 8 comma ester 4 quod,' end make
the seme person speek the whole. Though
4 quod ' is always the neuter of the relative,
whether it be translated 4 that: 4 beccus&
or ‘ but,' here it is “ used to connect 8 new
sentence with what precedes ” (Key’s L. G.
1454, i), and is not connected with 4 pondus '
as its antecedent.

note and Heindorf’s on this passage. Simi-

v. 25. Lambinus says that 4 hoc is to be
taken δεικτικῶς, 4 by 8ο much,’ “verbi
gratis, pilo et similibus.”

with him.

4 Plus ω’ (rather than 4 uam,'
which was the reading of all the ‘tione
except Bersmann's till Bentley, but with
little or much less MS. authority) occurs
again S. i. 6. 130, “victurum suavius ac si.”
S. i. 10. 34, ⁴‘ non ligna feras insenius ec

S. ii. 3. 270, 44 Nihilo plus explicet ac si
Insanire paret.'’ Cicero likewise uses ‘ ω’
with the comparative (Ad Att. xiii. 2),
