Tho words therefore express ι ιιιιιι well

Such ιιι οιιο, ssy the eommentstors, would
be more likely than another to notice the
seeming snomsly of Horace, the bacheler,
engaged ιιι relig-icus exet-<iseo on the day of
the Man-ondin. Elsewhere he sddresses his
petronas‘ Msecenssdocte’ (Epp. i. 19. 1).
