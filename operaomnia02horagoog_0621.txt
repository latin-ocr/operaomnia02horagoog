596 . HORATII FLAGOI

EPISTLE IX.
Aac. 7:34.

As to Septimius, on whose behnlf this Epistle is addressed to Tiberius, see C. ii. 6,
Introduction. The occasion was thet journey into Armenia which has been refer-red ω
twice before (Ep. 3 end 7). It is a well-considered and cereful produc-tion. Hor-cce
would have written more warmly for such an intimate friend if he could have ventured to
do sog but the character of 'liberius did not admit of wnrmth, and he would not have
responded ω my very eni-nest eulogy. Honoe therefore satisfies himself with mes-ely
naming his friend and excusing his own boldness ιιι doing so.

This Epistle is noticed m ιιιι amusing article of the Spectator (No. 49³) on the subjed
of introductione and testimonials' ιιι general, of which thia is quoted ns a judiciem sped-
men, and s. loose translationis there given.

Quanti me facias; nam cum rogat et prece cogit

Scilicet ut tibi se laudare et tradere coner,

Dignum mente domoque legentis honesta Neronis,

Munere cum fungi propioris censet amici, 5
Quid possim videt ac novit me valdius ipso.

Multa quidem dixi cur excusatus abirem ;
