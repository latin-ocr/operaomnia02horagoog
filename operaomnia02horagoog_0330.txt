Et decet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus, ⁵
Tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo.
Cetera mitte loqui z deus haec fortasse benigna

Reducet in sedem viee.

Nunc et Achaemenio

Perfundi nardo juvat et fide Cyllenea

Levare diris pectora sollicitudinibus;

Nobilis ut grandi cecinit Centaurus alumno:
Invicte‚ mortalis dea nate puer Thetide,

Te manet Assaraci telluS, quam frigida parvi
Findunt Scamandri flumina lubricus et Simoi'S,

therefore γούνατα λύειν is used for κτείνειν.
The expression θεῶν ἐν γοῦνασι κεῖται
(odyss. i. 267), which Dillenbr. quotes, and
which the Scholiast explains lv θεῶν ἐξουσίᾳ
ἐστι’, does not appear to have any bearing
ffisslsszaeion οὶ» {affl {23:⁸33ss
v. 33), ‘⁸ The lot is cest into the lap, but the
whole disposing thereos is of the Lord.’'
But, however this may be, ⁸ dum virent
genua ⁹ means merely ⁸ while our limbe are
strong and we are young! See Theoc. xvii.
70, where Wuestemann has collected various
examples. Dscier says truly the tottering
of the knees is one of the first signs of old

ἢ. obducta — fronte] ⁸ Clouded brow.’

So Juvenal (δ. ix. 1, 2) :—

⁸⁸ Scire yelim quare toties mihi, Nsevole,
om fronte οἱκίιιοίῑι.η

Eur. (Phoen. 1307), ἀλλὰ γὰρ Κρέοντα
λεύσσω τόνδε δεῦρο συννεφῆ-στείχοντα.
‘Senectus' is no where else used in this
sense of ‘melancholyl though ⁸ senium’ is
not uncommonly. See Forcell„ who does
not notice this nse of ‘senectus.' ‘Tu' is
the master of the feast. Sex. Manlius Tor-
quatus wss consul sume. 689, when Horace
was born. Compare ⁸⁴ Ο nata mecum con-
sule Manlio ” (iii. 21. l).

’1. Uetera] See Introduction, end C. i.
9. 9: ‘⁸ Permitte divis caetera.”

8. iu sedem] The commentatore quote
the words of Augustus' edict (Suet. Octav.
28)= ‘⁸ Ita mihi salvam sc sospitem Rem
Publicam sistere in sua sede liceat.”

Achaemenio] Venet. 1483, and nearly
all the editions till Bentley’s‚ with Comm.
cruq. and many MSS„ have ⁸ Achaemenis!
But ⁸ nardum ’ is the word, not ⁸ nardus,’ as
in Epod. v. 59: ⁸⁸ Nardo perunctum quale
non perfectius -——.''

9. fide Cyllenea] The ly're invented by
Mel-cury, born on Mount Cyllene in Ar-

cadia. ⁸ Diris,' not ⁸ duris.’ is the reading
of the oldest editions and nearly all the
Mss. Bentley prefers the latter.

11. Centaurus] Cheiron, the instructor
of Achilles. Orelli has collected a large
number of places in which this subject is
mentioned. Whether Horace took what
follows from any story or not it is impos-
sible to determine, as in the siufilar episode
of Teucer in C. i. 7.

φναηιῐί] Juvenal (vii. 210) describes
Achilles as a big boy at school, ⁸⁴ Metuens
wedfflefflfflm
meaning here, though some have supposed
it has.

13. sriqida] This is an adaptation of
Homer’s description (11. xxii. ¹⁵1.)² ἡ δ’
ἑτέρη θέρεϊ πρυρέει εἰκυῖα χαλάζῃ H χιόνι
ψυχρῇ. ⁸ Domus Assume: ⁸ proles Assa-
raci,’ are common in Vir-gil. Assaracus was
great-grandfather of Aeneas. Homer took
a more heroic view of the dimensione of the
river Scamander, which was μέγας ποταμὸς
βαθυδίνης (11. 11. 73). Bentley suggests
⁸ proni ’ for ⁸ parvi ς’ others have proposed
‘pravi’ (that is, ‘tortuous'), ‘puri,’ ‘flavi,'
⁸ tardi! But the MSS. do not vary.

15. subtemine] ⁸ The woof of the web.’
⁸ Certo subtemine ' means only by an un-
alterable destiny. There is no need of
Bentley’s alteration to ⁸ curto, ' nor of
taking ⁸ certo subtemine' with ‘ Parme: as if
it were the adverb of quality, signifying the
⁸ Parcse' whose woof of destiny is unalter-
able. See catull. 64. 328, διας “Currite
ducentes subtemina currite fusi.” ⁸ Mater
caerula' means Thetis, nottho sea, as Com.
Cruq. supposes.

18. alloquiis] If the true reading is
without any conjunctim, ⁸ alloquiis' would
appear to be in apposition with ⁸ vino can-
tuque! There is no other instance of ⁸ allo-
quium ' being used otherwise than with refer-
ence to conversation. But Horace may have
followed, after his mutum of imitating the
