EPISTULARUM I. 19. 645

have praised good wine if he had not liked it; and as for father Ennius, he never began
to sing till he was drenched. As soon as ever 1 issued my edict that the Forum was
only fit for the sober, and that song was not for the serious, straightway all our poeta
began to drink night and day. But what, shall a man look stern and go bare-footed
and with scanty toga, like Catu, and then think he is imitating Cato's virtues? Iar-
bitas broke his heart with envy of Timagenes, end tried in vain to be elegant and
eloquent as he.

(v. 17.) An example only ιο be followed· m its defects‘ is sure to mislead, and yet if Ι 1)γ
any chance were to look pale, they would all be taking cummin to make them look so
too. The servile herd! how their fuss stirs my bile and mirth by turns.

(v. 21.) 1 was the first to tread new ground, and he who has confidence in himself may
always lead the swarm. 1 was the first to bring the iambic into Latium, imitating the
measure but not the subjecte and fieree spirit of Archilochus, even as Alcaeus and
Sappho mingled his measures but not his temper with their own. Ι then was the first
to make him known to my countrymen3 and it is my delight that the 'good read
and handle what Lhave written. But why do any read me greedily at home and only
go abroad ιο abuse me? Because 1 do not condescend to canvass the critice and buy
their approbation. This is what annoys them. And if 1 say, ‘⁴ Ι care not that my
poor verses should be recited to crowded audiences ;” ‘⁶ Ohl you mock us,” say they,
“and are keeping your fine things for ears divine; for of course honey only comes
from your hive: you are the only fine gentleman‚ in your own eyesl’ 1 am afraid ιο
retort, so 1 only ssy, “ 1 don't like your ground, and beg a postponement of the
φοι-ι ;” for such sport only leads ιο wrath, and wrath ιο fighting and bloodshed.

Pmsco si credis, Maecenas docte, Gratim,

Nulla placere diu nec vivere carmina possunt
Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus. Ut male sanos

l. Maecenas docte, Gratiam] He ad- Porphyrion remarks, is a military
dresses Maecenas elsewhere as “doctus
utriusque linguae” (C. iii. 8. 5). Cratinus,
though he lived ιο a good old age, and kept
his powers to the last, as we have seen
(S. i. 4. 1, n.) ,was a proverbial drunltsrd.
Aristophanes <lgm ,703) says he died of the

therefore to ‘ adam-ipsit ’ he adds ‘in le-

Fauns, Pans, and Satyrs, see note on C. ii.
19. 4. The poets immediately under the
pmoection of Dionysus were the lyric, the
dithyramb having been performed first at
the Dionysia. Compare C. i. 1. 31:

broken to pieoes3 on which the Scholiast
says. ὅτι φΡίλοινος ὁ Κρατῖνος καὶ αὐτὸς
ἐν τῇ Πυτίνῃ λέγει σαφῶς. This play was
that which gained him the prize against
Aristophanes the year before he died, when
he was ninety· fivey years old. He kept up
his jovial spirit therefore to the last. In
Athenaeus (ii. 9, p. 149, Schwg.) there is
an epigram of Nicenaetus:

οἶνός τοι χαρίεντι πέλει ταχὺς ἵππος
ὕδωάοέἔῷ’ πίνων οὐδὲν ἂν τέκοι σοφόν.

ταῦτ’ ἔλεγεν, Διόνυσε, καὶ ἔπνεεν οὐχ ἑνὸς
Κρέτζὶἰί, ἀλλὰ παντὸς ὠδώδει πίθου.

“Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori

So the poet is ealled‘ ‘cliens Bacchi”

(Epp. ii. 2. 78). Liber, the Latin divinity,
is here, as elsewhere, confounded with the
Greek Bocchus οι· Dionysus, with whom he
had only this in common, that he presided
over vines. So in C. i. 16. 7 the mad-
dening Dionysus is called Liber, and
Alcaeus is ssid to have sung of ⁴ Libe-
rum et Musas Veneremque ’ (C. i. 32.
9). Ῑιι C. iii. 21. 21, Liber is associated
with the Grsces who were the earliest
attendants of Dionysus. (See Pi'nd. Ol.
xiii. 18.) Ῑιι C. i. 12. 21 he is spoken of
as ‘proeliis audaxf with reference to the
