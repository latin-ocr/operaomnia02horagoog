CARMEN XV.

ΛΑΜ). 741.

This ode appetu-e in only times to heve been read ns port of the fourteenth. The
Scholimt Porphyrion says, ‘⁶ Quidam separant hanc oden n superiore, ned potest illi jungi
quoniam hic lendes dicuntur Augusti.” This is a poor reason, ond there can be little
doubt the odes were written eepmtely, though probably about the nme time, on the
κιαι-ιι of Augustus to Rome, A.u.c. 741. In consequence of the mention made in v. 9 of
the cloeing of the temple of Jnnus, n later date is assigned to the ode, namely, A.u.c. 74⁵,
when it is affin-med (but without sufficient reason, ns Frnnke hae shown) that the temple m
closed, for the third time during the life os Augustus. But us it had been closed twice
before and Horace does not specify the particular time, hut merely affirma what might heve
been nid with equnl truth any year nster 725. thie argument provee nothing. 1f we may
nonme, u hes been assumed throughout this book, that it wne publinhed, ns Suetonius
mys, for the sake of the odeo in honour of Augustus' step-eone, then it is highly improbable
that the publication was delnyed for four years, und there is nothing in this ode which
might not heve been written on his return, but much reason to suppose it was. An thet
io here mid of the subjection of the world und the universal peuce wne said in effect nt the
close of the som-teenth ode3 but it wan natural that, if Horace hed received the emperor-'e
commende to publieh another book of odes, he should conclude it with oue uddreeeed
to Augustus himself, reviewing the bleesings of his reign which at this time had been
oeowncd by e serice of succenseo by which universal peuce veae established.

When 1 would sing of were Phoebus checked me with his lyre. Thy reign, O Caesar,
hath brought beck our lost honour, with plenty end penca and order md the nenne
by which our name md mngth heve become great. Under thy protection we seor no
ware et home or ebroed3 the North und the Eut obey thy lewe, end we with our wive-
nnd children will sing of the heroes of old, of Troy, end Anchises, and of Venus’ eon.

PHoEnus volentem proelia me loqui
Victus et urbes increpuit lyra,
Ne parva. Tyrrhenum per aequor
Vela. darem. Tua, Caesar, aetas
