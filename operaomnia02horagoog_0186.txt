CARMEN VII.

The idea of this grsceful ode is thet of s young girl lamenting the absence of her lover,
who is gone en a trading voyage to the Euxine. The nemos, as usual in these composi-
tione, ere foreign. Gyges is Lydien. The time is winter. The lover is supposed to be
on his voyage home end detained on the coest os Epirus, whither he hed been driven by
the southerly vinds which prevsiled at that senson. Heis waiting sor the spring to return
home. There is great simplicity and beenty in this ode. Orelli reckons it among Horace's
best. Whether itis original or a free copy from the Greek we cannot determine.
