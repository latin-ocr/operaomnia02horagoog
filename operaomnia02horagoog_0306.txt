EPODON LIBER, 4. 281

CARMEN IV.

All the positive information we can derive from this ode in respect to its purport and
date is, that it contains a vehement invective against some person of low birth and con-
temptible character, who gave himself airs and disgusted the people of Romez he was
also a military tribune. The approximate time is fixed by the last lines, which show that
it was written while Augustus was preparing or carrying on war against Sextus Pom-
peius, who had enlisted in his service pirates and slaves, as we learn from Dion and the
other historians. (See below, ix. 10.) To bring us nearer to‚the exact date, it has been
argued (first by Messon in his life of Horace) that, inasmuch as in the second expedition
of Caesar against Sex. Pompeius there were enlisted in his fleet a great body of slaves, it
is not probable that Horace would have used language of contempt which would apply as
much to Augustus' as the enemy's force. It must therefore have been written, if this
assumption has any weight‚ before that armament was formed, which was A.u.c. 717. In
716 there desei-ted to Augustus, Pompeius' lieutenant Menas or Menodorus (C. iii. 16.
15. n.), and it was in consequence of the advantage gained by this man's defection that
Augustus declared war against Pompeius, in which war he sustained two severe defeats3
after which he suspended operations for a twelvemonth, and during that period it is said
with confidenoe this Epode was written. It is also stated by all the Scholiasta that Menas
is the subject of this lampeon. The greater number of modern 111-11106 doubt their accurwy,
and the name ‘ Vedius Rufus ' occurring in one or two inscriptions that name has been
fixed upon instead of Menas', though no attempt is made to identify him with any histo-
rical character. The objections raised to Menas being the person alluded to are: l. That
Horace would not have failed to notice the treachery as well as the pride of this person.
But that argument, which is Gesner’s, has no great force. Horace meant to attack the
swaggering airs of the man, which were more offensive to the citizens than his betrayal of
Pompeius, by which they had gained and which could not have been noticed without
offending Augustus. 2. That Menas had been so short a time in Rome that he could not
hare been possessed of large landed property, and having charge of the fleet would have
had no opportunity of making himself unpopular in the manner here described. But no
length of time was wanted for these objecta. He had no doubt made himself rich before
he bati-ayed his trust, having had plenty of opportunities for doing so, and probably he
did not sell his conscience and his trust for nothing. He had had time to invest his
money, become a favoured guest of Augustus, and have his head turned3 and a very few
exhibitione of himself in the character here described would be enough to call forth this
short 1611190011. 3. That Menas was not an eques. But he was elevated to that rank by
Augustus, as we learn from Dion (xlviii. 45); and at any rate, if he had but the regulated
income of an eques, he had the privileges of that order at least as regards a seat in the
theatra. 4. Itis affirmed that Menas could not be called a ‘ tribunus militum,’ inasmuch as
he who had been under Pompeius the governor of two large islanda (Sardinia and Corsica),
as well as admiral of his fleet and commender of three legions, would have held a higher
post under Augustus, who had received and continued to treet him with great respect.
But it is a matter of history that Menas' desertion of Augustus and return to his old
master arose out of his discontent with the rank given him by the former, and it is hard
to say what that rank may at any given time have been. It was always subordinat03 and,
though we learn he rose to be legatus to Calvisius Sabinus the chief admira, he may at
first only have been a military tribune, which post however would at once give him eques-
trian rank ex officio (see S. i. 6. 25, n.). 5. It is said we do not know that Menas ever
was flogged3 but that he was once a slave (he was a freedman of Pompeius Magnus) was
enough to give rise to such an asset-tion 111 a satire of this kind, whether it was known to
be true or not. Thus Ι do not think there is sufficient inter-nal evidence to impugn the
