HORATII FLAGOI

Vidi egomet nigra succinctam vadere palla
Canidiam pedibus nudis passoque capilIn,

Cum Sagana majore ululantem: pallor utrasque
Scalpere terram

Fecerat horrendas adspectu.

Unguibus et pullam divellere mordicus agnam
Coeperunt ; cruor in fossam confusus ut inde
Manes elicerent, animas responsa daturas,

Lanea et effigies erat, altera cerea: major

Lanea‚ quae poenis compesceret inferiorem;

Lucretius so uses ‘ suevit' (vi. Βᾶθι “ Qui
ferri quoque vim penetrare suevit!

23. Vidn· eqomet niqra] The god pro-
ceeds to relate a scene that happened before
the tombs were cleared away (v. 36), in
which the characters introduced are the
notorious Canidia of whom we have seen
enough in the Epodes, and a, who is
associated with her in Epod. v. 25, sqq.
Their appearance and behaviour are much
the same as there. The principal person
is Canidia, who wears a dark ‘pallass is
without shoes‚ and has her hair dishevelled
(in Epod. v. 15 it is tangled with little
snakes). The moon is up and she invokes
her (Epod. v- 50), while her companion
invokes one of the furies. They are both
deadly pale. They grub up the earth with
their nails, and pour into the bole the blood
of a black lamb (black victims were sacri-
ficed to the infernal deities , which they
tear to pieces with their teeth, y which pro-
cess they hope to evoke spirits of the dead
ιο answer their enquiries about their lovers.
Canidia has two images‚ one of wool and
the other of wax, the first representing her-
self, the other her faithless lover, on whom
she is going to wreak her vengeance. We
may suppose it therefore to represent the
unhappy Varus of Epod. v. Snakes and
Hecate’s hounds surround them, and at
the height of their incantatione the moon
blushes with shame, and hides her face
behind the tombs (great barrows formed by
the burial of a number of corpses in one
pit). During their rites, in which they hide
the heard of a wolf and the tooth of a

Manes which have been evoked converse
with them in a melancholy sharp voice;
and just when the flames which were
to melt the devoted image of wax are
at their height the ludicrous catastrophe
happens that puts them all to ssight,—
Canidia with her jaws chattering with fright,
and her false teeth dropping out, Sagana

with her wig flying off, and all ha· herbs
and love-knots falling about, as they make
the best of their way to the city.

niqra succinctam vadere palla] The
⁴ palla ’ was the upper gal-ment worn by
women out of doors as the meu wore the
toga. (See S. 2. 29, n.) Here, iu conse-
quence of the expression ⁸ succinctam,’
Heindorf and other commentator-s, and For-
cellini, suppose ‘palla ' to be put loosely for
the under garment, which was gathered up
and girt under ‘the breast. But there is no

signifies ⁴ expedioem‚’ as in Epod. v. 25. It

samiam {naam ἐς 3:
107: “ veluti succinctus cursitat hospes.”

25. C'um Saqana παύση] The Scholiasta
say that Sagana was the freedwoman of
one Pomponius, and that she had a younger
sister, whence she is called ‘ major! It
probably signifies that she was older than
Canidia, as Doering says.

27. pullam] Aeneas offers a black lamb
to Nox and Terra Aen. vi. 249): ‘⁴ Ipse
atri velleris agnam eneas matri Eumeni·
dum magnaeque sorori Ense ferit.” Tibullus
uses the same word as Horace (i. 2. 61):

‘⁶ Et me lustravit taedis et nocte serem
Concidit ad magicos hostia pulla deos?

28. cormacus] ⁴ Poured and stirred!
Compare Tibull. (ἰ. 2. 45):

‘⁴ Haec cantu finditque solum, Manesque
Εὒοῗὲῗέὴιεᾞίάο devocat ossa rogo.”

30. Lanea et ffqies erat, attera cerea ε]
The meaning of the woollen image which
was to punish the waxen one is not very
clear. The wax was to melt, aud as it melted
so was the lover ιο consume in the fires of
love, according to the witch’s chal-m in
Theocritus (ii. 28), noticed on Epod. xvii.
