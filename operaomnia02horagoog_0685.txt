HORATII FLAOOI

Si quia Graecorum eunt antiquissima quaeque
Scripta vel optima Romani pensantur eadem

Scriptores trutina, non eat quod multa loquamur:

Venimus ad summum fortunae;

pingimus atque

Psallimus et luctamur Achivis doctius unctis.
Si meliora dies 111, vina poemata reddit,

Scire velim chartis pretium quotus arroget annus.

Scriptor abhinc annos centum qui decidit inter
Perfectos veteresque referri debet, an inter

Inter quos referendus erit? veteresne poetas,
An quos et praesens et postera respuat aetas?
Iste quidem veteres inter ponetur honeste

Qui vel mense brevi vel toto est junior anno.

45. caudaeque pilae ut equinae] When
the 00111ἰο10 of Sertorius insisted on attack-
ing the enemy against his wish, and were
beaten, he took the following 11100110 of
showing thern their error and the policy he
chose to pursue. He put before them two
1101000, 0110 0111 and infirm, the other young

and freeh with 0 remarkably fine tail. ·A

sla-ong man stood by the old horne, 0 small
man by the young one. Tbey were 1100110ιί

animala, and the strong man pulled at his

eeeded to pull out⁸ the hairu of the other one
by one. The weak man soon aeeomplished
his work, while the strong 111011 of course
failed. (Plutarch, vit. Sert- 0. 16.) Ho-
