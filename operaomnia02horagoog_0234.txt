Crede veloci, nisi herile mavis

sharp edges are fatal. Itis not quite clear
whether we are ιο suppose Agenor (Europe' s
father) top propose the eholee of all these
forms of death, or to speek any of these
words οι· all of them. The editions are
generallypointed so as to lead tothe oon-
dnsion that‘ vilis Europe 'are the words of
the girl addressing herself, and her father’ s

imaginun-y invective ιο end with ‘ qnid mori

‘ullo modo’ be assigned ιο Agenor. As a
matter of taste 1 prefer supposiug the whole
ιο be the langnage of Europa addressing
herself, as Ι bave taken ιι ιιι the Argument,
bnt the question is not worth discussing.
Europe puts the words into her father's
mouth, or she uses them against herself,
beeause she thinks he will reproach and re-
iect her, so that it eomes ιο the same thing
either way.
