Auctore Phoebo ter pereat meis
Excisus Argivis, ter uxor
Capta virum puerosque ploret.
Non hoe jocosae conveniet lyrae:

Quo, Musa, tendis?

Desine pervicax

Referre sermones deorum et
Magna modis tenuare parvis.

85. mum αέπειιε] Horace in pertinl to

this epithet- See Epp. i. 1. 6⁰,

And below (C. 9. 18),—
“ Diductoeqne jugo cogit aeneo-’⁹
C. 16. 1,-
“ ——- turris aenea

It means no more in this derived use than
strength end mbility. Gellius (ii. 3)
says it was wn’tten ⁸ ebenus? the aspirato
being introduced in this as in other words
⁴which he mentions for no other reason
“nisi ut firmitas et vigor vocis qussi qui-
busdam nimis additis intenderetur.” But ns
he appliee the same remark to ⁸ onus,'
‘ onustum‚’ ⁸ lacrumo. ' (which he spells ⁴ la-
ehryma’), we must suppose thet the MSS.
he followed were none of the best. But his
remark confirms Bentley’s on S. ii. 3, 183,
where he deserte the received reading ⁴ eut

quam enim aeneus trisyllabon apud veteres
poetas invenias (nisi forte ubi prave edi-

66. Auctore Phoebo,] Bentley would
like to change ⁸ κηποι-θ’ into ⁸ menore:
but would not object to ‘ ductore,' because
Horace says elsewhere,

Amo mu‘goa ;” potiore ductos

end Vix-gil says (Aen. i. 423 , ⁸ pere ducere
παπ-σι’ Bentley's morbid eeire to change
the received text ns osten es he could comes
out in this case. Horace might esproperly
say ⁴ auctore Phoebo,' es Vix-gil ‘ Troiae
Cynthius auctor’ (G. iii. 36).

69. Non hoe joc-oeae conveniet] The
MSS. vary greatly in these words: ‘haec
conveniunt ⁹ is the reading of most editions,
⁸ hoc conveniet ' of most MSS„ including
the Ber-ne and Blendinian.

CARMEN IV.

About A.11.c. 728.

Pursuing his purpose, Horace here commende the power os wisdom end learning in
subdning brute force and violent passione. It A.u.c. 728 be the year in which Horace
met with his accident (C. ii. 13), this ode could not have been written before that year,
for the circumstance is referred to in v. 27. The expedition intended for Britain, but
turned against Spain, took place that year, and seems to Frenke to be alluded to in the
ninth stnnzn. A Parthian expedition was in contemplation at the same time. The allu-
sions to violent men unrestreined by the Muses appear to the same writer to heve refer-
ence to Cornelius Gallus end M. Equafius Rufus, both disafl'eeted men, the former of
whom destroyed himself, end the latter conspired against Augustus’ life, both in the above
yur (Dion. em. li1i.2³, 24). This may or may not be true, but it is consistent with
the notion, which some chronologice ere not, thet all these six odes were written about the
