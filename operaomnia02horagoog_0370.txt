SATIRARUM Ι. 2.

J anua frangatur, latret oanis, undique magno
Pulsa domus strepitu resonet, vepallida lecto

Desiliat mulier, miseram se conscia clamet,

Cruribus haec metuat, doti deprensa, egomet mi.
Discincta tunica fugiendum est ac pede nudo,
Ne nummi pereant aut puga aut denique fama.
Deprendi miserum est; Fabio vel judice vincam.

129. vepallida] On this Bentley has a

takes away the force of the adj ective.
Persius (S. i. 97, ‘vegrandi subere coctum ’)
is quoted m support οἷ· vepdlida3’ but the
reading and sense are both doubtful there·

even ’if that be the reading. ‘vepallida’
has the support of the best MSS„ and is a
legitimate word.

1³⁰. comeda] The ‘anema' who was

ease of slaves. ‘pDe rensa’ means the mis-
