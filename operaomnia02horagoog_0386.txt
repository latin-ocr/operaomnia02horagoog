SATIRARUM I. 4. 361

ARGUMENT.

Greet was the liberty wherewith those worthies of the old comedy set their mark upon
the viciens, and them Lucilius has copied3 a man of wit and perception, but s harsh
versifierg caring less for the quality of his verses than the quantity, fun of words and
full of faults, which he was too lazy to avoid. As to your quantity, 1 care not for that;
and when Crispinus challenges me at great odds to try which of us can write quiekest,
1 decline the invitation, and thank heaven that I am a man of quiet temper-ament and
few words. He may go on puffing and blowing like a pair of bellom, but that is not
in my way.

(v. 21.) Fannius gets a testimonial from his admirere, while no one will read what I write
(end Ι am too nervous to meite it in public), beccum men do not like to have their
faults exposed, and there are few who are not open to blame. Take any man out of a
crowd, he is avaricious or ambitious or lecherous, or he dotes upon fine plato or fine
statues3 or is running about the world to make his fortune. All such are afraid of
verses like mine, and hate those who write them. ‘⁴ Take cere of 111111ς he is danger-cusi
all he ceres for is to get up 0 leugh and amuse the old women and children at the
expense of his friends.”

(v. ³8.) Now let me say s word in reply. In the first place I do not profess to be a poet.
Six feet in a verse which otherwise is mere prose, this does not make a poet, but
genius, inspirat-ion, and sublime langusge. And this has led some to question whether
comedy is poetry‚ seeing that the language and ideas are all those os common life.
There are your fathers, for instance, scolding their sons, just ss you may hear every
day; moreover you may shuffie the words as you plesse in true poetry without alter-
ingthe sense, but that is not the cese with Lucilius' language and mine (you must read
it as you would prose, or you make nonsense of it).

(v. 6³.) But this question 1 may discuss elsewhere. My present purpose is to show that
you heve no resson to be afraid of this sort of writing. There are your informers who
go about and ere the terror of all regnes: the honest man may despise them. But,
even supposing you are the rogue, 1 am no informer. 1 have no desire to have my
books thumbed by the vulgar, or to reed them to any but my friends, and that only
when prest. There are many 1 grant you who bawl their verses in the forum and in
the public bathe, but they are mere blockheads. ‘⁴ But we know you love to snn0y‚ and
do it with malicions intent.” How can you charge me with this? Nsy‚ the man who
slanders his friend behind his back, or fails to defend him from the 0101111οι- of others,
who sims only at being called a wit, who invents falsehoods and blabs sem-ets, thet man
is a scoundrel; let every honest citizen avoid him. 1 have often been st table when one
of the company has amused himself with breaking his wit upon the guests, not sparing
the host himself when he gets warm3 now this man you look upon as a funny fellow,
while for my innocent satire 1 am called malignam, sarcestic, and so forth. Whe'n
your friend Petillius is mentioned you defend him aster your own fashion, that is, you
damn him with s sneer, the veriest poison, which shall never be found, if 1 know
myself at all, in any thing 1 may write.

(v. 103.) If 1 have spoken a little too freely of others 1 may be portioned on this ground:
my excellent father always taught me by examples. If he would have me live fmgussy,
he would say, ‘⁶ Look at the misery to which our friend Albius’ son and Barrus have
reduced themselves by their extravagance.” When he would keep me from bed women,
‘⁸ Take Sectsnus for a warning.” ‘⁶ See what scandal attaches to Trebonius-” ‘⁸ Wiser
men may teach you by precept and theory, my care shall be to watch over your prse-
tice till you are able to take care of yourself.” If he would have me do something that
was right, he would take one of the judices and say, ‘⁸ There is an example for you. '⁹
