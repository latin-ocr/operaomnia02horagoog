Ducere sollicitae jucunda oblivia vitae3
Ο quando faba Pythagorae cognata simulque
Uncta satis pingui ponentur oluscula lardo?

Ο noctes coenaeque deum! quibus ipse meique

Ante Larem proprium vescor vernasque procaces

Pasco libatis dapibus.

Siccat inaequales calices conviva, solutus·

63. faba Pythonos-ac caynam] The
popular notion was ssiat Pythagoras had
taught his disciples to abstsin as from meat
so from beans, which class of vegetables he
connected somehow or other with the
human species in his doctrine of metem-
psychosis, though different reasons are
assigned by different writers (see Cic. de
Div. i. 303 ii. 58. Plut. de Lib. Educ. c.
17. Diog. Laert. viii. ξ 24 and 34); and
Gellius (iv. ll) affirms that the fact is not
to be believed, quoting Aristoxenus, who,
in his work on the doctrines of Pythagoras.
declat-ed that above all vegetables that phi-
losopher preferred the bean.

that those vegetsbles were forbidden fare to
the disciples of Pythagoras, under the fan·-
ciful notion that in eating them they might
be devouring their own flesh and blood.
Hence the expression ⁴ cognata,' and this is
the allusion in Epp. i. 12. 21, ⁴⁸ seu porrum

65. O noctes comaeque deum Ι] Tur-
nebus compares the frugal feasts laid out in
the temples as described stom his own ob·
servation by Dionys. Halic. (lib. ii. , ὶγὼ
γοῦν ἐθεασάμην ἐν ἱεραῖς οἰκίαις εἶπνα
παρακείμενα θεοῖς, ἐν τραπέζαις ξυλίνοις
ἀρχαῖκαῖς, ἑν κὰνοις καὶ πινακίσκοις κερα-
μέοις, ἀλφίτων μάζας καὶ πόπανα καὶ ζέας
καὶ καρπῶν τινόν ἀπαρχὰς, καὶ ἄλλα τοι·

Πυθαγόρας

αὕτα λῖτα, καὶ εὐδάπανα, καὶ πάσης ἀπει-
ροκαλίας ἀπηλλαγμένα.

66. Ante Larem proprium] See note
on Epod. ii. 66. ⁴ Libatis dapibus ' means
that the master and his friends (‘ meique’)
dined lightly, and left the greater part of
the dishes to his slaves. The master, in
this instance, as well as his slaves, dined in
the ⁸ atrium,’ where the images of the Laroe
were placed. ‘ [libare ' is to touch lightly.
See Aen. v. 90, “ inter pateras et levia
pocula serpens Libavitque dapes ;” and
Ovid (Am. i. 4. 3⁴) :—

. ‘⁴ si tibi forte dabit quos praegustaverit ipse

Rejice libatos illius ore cibos.”

The distribution of the remains of the din-
ner to the slaves is mentioned as a matter
οἰ course by Seneca (Ep. 78): ‘⁴ Marcel-
linum admonuit non esse inhumanum
quemadmodum coena peracta reliquiae
circumstantibus dividuntur, sic peracta vita
aliquid gon-igi his qui totius vitae ministri
fuisse’ nt.

69. Leqt‘bus insanin] See S. 2. 123, n.
Cicero, describiug Verres' riotous living,
says, “ iste enim praetor severus ac diligens
qui populi Romani legibus nunquam paru-
isset, illis diligenter legibus quae in poculis
ponebantur obtemperabat '⁸ (Act. ii. l. δ.
c. 11). One of the strictest laws of a ban-
quet directed by a presiding symposiarch
would have reference to the regulation of
the quantity of wine to be drunk by each
guest at each round. Horace's notion of
liberty here is to be able to drink as much
or as little as he pleased, which is expressed
by ⁴ inaequales calices!

70. uvescit] Lambinus introduced this
reading from some of his MSS„ which were
confirmed by Cruquius, and since by many
more. The old reading was ⁴ humescit!
⁸ Uvescere ' does not occur elsewhere, but
it corresponds with Horace's word ‘ uvidus,'
C. ii. 19. 18, “Tu separatis uvidus in jugis 3⁹⁹
and iv. 5. 38, “ Dicimus integro Sicci
