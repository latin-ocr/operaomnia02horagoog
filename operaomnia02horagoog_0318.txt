Then the processioa passed through the
Forum till it reached the spot where was
afterwards built and still stands the arch of
Septimius Severus, close to which, under the
east side of the Mons Capitolinus, was the
Carcer Tullianus or Mamertinus, the great
prison built, as tradition said, by Servius
Tullius. At the above spot the mptives were
taken off to this prison, as C. Pontius the
Samnite general was, and usually strangled
at once. The procession then having arrived
near the gate it started from, wound its way
up the Mons Capitolinus till it reached the
Capitol. If thisP description (with the help
of which any map of the city will enable
the student to follow the triumphal proces-
sion) be correct, and if the whole circuit of
the Campus Maximus was ιιι-88018011, the
distance passed over must have been not
lessthan six miles. The part oftheroad
which Horace (C.' iv. 2. 35) calls tho· &cer

the Templum Pacis and the Forum.
