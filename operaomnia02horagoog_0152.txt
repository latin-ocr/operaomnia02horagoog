CARMEN XVIII.
After A.U.c. 720.

This ode, which denis with Horaee's cavom-ite subjecta, the levelling power of death, and
the vanity of wenlth, aud the sehemes of the wenlthy, is dedicated to no particular stione,
and is another proof ofthe littlevslueor eharsderthstodesofthiselassdaivefmma

that the name we find in conjunctiora with such odes must usually be looked upon aa nou-
enaentinl, and that to draw inferenees from the ode, iu respect to the individual nomin-ily
nddrenaed, is a misuka. C. iii. 24 beers s sh-ong resemblance to this ode, which must

In waiting the first few verses Horsoe may have had in mind some lines of Bacchylides,
inviting the Dioscuri to feast with him, preserved in Athenaeus (28 Bergk),

ARGUMENT-

No gold iu my roos, no marble in my hall, no palaea have 1, nor female clientsto serre me,
but 1 have hone-ty aud undu-standing, and though 1 be poor 1 am courted by the rich:
what more should 1 ask of the gods or my friend, content with my single Sabine
estete. ² Dtys are puningon, md, though reedyto drop into thy grave, thou art build-
ing end sueoehiug thy bon-dm, sud tem-ing up the landmarks of thy client, and driving
him {rom his home. But to what purpose is this? To Hades thou must go in the end·
the earth opens to neh and poor· Prometheus the mfty, and Tantalus the proud, they
oennot ese-pm and the poor man finds in death a release from his toils, whether he

seek it or not.
