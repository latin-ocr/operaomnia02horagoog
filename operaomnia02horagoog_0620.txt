EPISTOLARUM Ι. 8.

Onnso gaudere et bene rem gerere Albinovano
Musa rogata refer, comiti scribaeque Neronis.
Si quaeret quid agam, dic multa et pulchra minantem

Vivere nec recte nec suaviter;

haud quia grando

Oontuderit vites oleamque momorderit aestus, 5 .
Nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in agris;

Sed quia mente minus validus quam corpore toto

Nil audire velim, nil discere, quod levet aegrum3

Fidis offendar medicis, irascar amicis,

Gur me funesto properent arcere veterno ς

lo

Quae nocuere sequar, fugiam quae profore credam 3
Romae Tibur amem ventosne, Tibure Romam.
Post haec ut valeat, quo pacto rem gerat et se,

Ut placeat juveni percontare utque cohorti.

Si dicet, Recte, primum gaudere, subinde

Praeceptum auriculis hoc instillare memento:
Ut tu fortunam sic nos te, Oelse, feremus.

7. 23, ιι. The following words in this Epistle
heve been referred to in former notes:
⁴ quid egam ’ (Epp. 3. 15), ‘minantem ' (S,
ii. 3. 9), ‘ momorderit ' (S. ii. 6. 45), ‘cur
(C. i. 33. 3), ‘cohorti' (S. i. 7. 23).
⁴ Suaviter ' occurs in the same connexion
in S. i. 9. 5. ⁸ Multa et pulchra minantem'
Comm. Cruq. explains rightly 1 think:
‘¹ promittentem philosophica& It refers
to his philosophica} aspiratione described in
Epp. i. 1. Orelli refers it to his poetical
studies chiefly. I do not agree with him.

Po, heve been referred to before (C. iii. 16.
35; Epod. i. 27). The levying of a tax on
ssocks fed on the southern pastmes, referred
to in the latter of those notes, has been
continued to modern times. At the towu
of Foggia in Paglia (Apulia), Swinburne
says there is ‘⁸ s. register office known by
the neme of ‘'h-ibunele della dogma della
mena delle peoere di Puglia ⁹ (the custom-
house for the toll of the sheep that pass to
und stom Puglia). It is managed by a

upon ull sheep that descend in autumn from

the mountuins of Abruzzo into the wax-m
plains of Puglia‚ where they yson, and in
May return to the high country-'⁹ “This
dogma is one of the richest mines os weelth
belonging to the crown of Nuples‚ and is
capable of great increase. At present (1777)
the net proiit arising to the king from the
letting of the pastures is about 40, 000
ὀαωιεΡ The reading‘ arvis’ which 'ep-
peurs in some editions and MSS. is inad-
missible. That word is used for aruble
lund. ‘Ager ⁹ applies to that und pastun
and other lands too.
