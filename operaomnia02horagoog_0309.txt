284 HORATII FLAGGI

CARMEN V.

There is so much likeness between this singular ode and part of the eighth Satire of the
first book, that it is generally supposed they were written about the same time, or ahout
A.tr.c. 721. A soene is represented in which the unfortunate woman Canidia (Ep. 3. 8,
n.), so unmercifully satirized by Horace for a suecession of years, is the chief ach-esa She
is passionately in love with one Varus, whom she calls an old sinner but whose heart she
is resolved to win. To this end she resorts to magieal phili-ers, for the composition of
which, in company with three other witebes, she gets a boy of good family, strips him
naked and bur-ies him up to his chin in a hele, in order that there with food put before
him he might wither away in the midst of longing, and so his liver might form, in eon-
junotion with other ingrediente, a love-potion to be administered to the faithless Varus.
What eould have put such a soene into Horaee’s head it is hard to say ς but in ireating it
as one that actually happened, and that at Naples (from v. 43), Porphyrion and those who
have followed him show more simplicity than iudgment. That the scene does not even
profess to be laid at Naples is clear from the dogs of the Saburra (58) and the vultures
of the Esquiline hill (100) being introduced.

ARGUMENT.

“ Tell me, by the gods, by thy children, if Lucina hath ever blessed thee, by this purple
toga which should protect my childhood, tell me what meaneth this horrid soene. Why
look ye at me so sternly ?’' As these words drop from the trembling and naked child,
Canidia bids them bring branches from the tombs, a screeeh-owl's wing and egga steeped
in frog’s blood, poisonous herba of Tbessaly and Hiberia, and bones snatched from the
jaws of a hung-ry biteh, to burn in the magio flames. Sagana meanwhile sprinkles waters
of Avernus over the chamber, and Veia digs a pit where the boy must stand buried to
the chin that his marrow and liver may dry up and become fit ingrediente for the potion.
Folia too is there eharming stara and moon from the sky. Then Canidia burste forth,
saying, “ Night and Diana avenge me on my enemies. Give me such an ointment to
smear the old man with that the dogs may bark at him as he goes to his vile hauuts.
But what ia this? How did Medea suceeed while 1 fail? 1 know every herb. 1 have
anointed his bed. 1 see, Ι see. Some charm more skilled has set him free. No eom-
mon potion therefore, no hacknied spell will I prepare for thee, Varus: the skies shall
sink below the sea if thou burn not with love for me.” Then the boy breaks out into
oux-sing, and says, “The destiny of man is unchangeable. 1 will curse you, and my
curse no sacrifice shall avert. My ghost shall haunt you by night, and tear your flesh,
and rob you of sleep. Men shall stone you, and wolves and vultures shall tear your
unburied messes, and my parents shall live to see it.”
