SATIBARUM 1. 3. 347

pretty names for his ugly boy’s defects. Let the close be called thristyg the silly mun
who is a little too prone to boeot, say he is anxious to pleese3 the rude and off-hsnded,
let him be natural und manly; the pusionete, high spirited ;-—this is the way to make
friends and to keep them. But we do just the reverse, turning virtues into defecta.

An honest men is a driveuoe3 the slew-und sure is s hogg the prudent ond cautious, e

what rushness thus to establish a rule which must reect upon ourselves. Au have their
faults3 he is beet who hes fewest. Let my friend weigh my good with my bed, und 1
will do the seme by him. If he would not heve his great deformities offend my eye,
let him leam to orei-look my little ones: who would heve indulgence must show it.

In short, since the defects of fools, according to your Stoic theory, eennot be got rid οῖ.
it is reasonable we should judge others os we judge ourselves, und visit ench stult with
no more than its due censure. The men who should hung his slave sor eeting the
remnants of his fish must be med 3 but he in not less med who for some triffing fault
hstes his friend. Because ο. friend breaks my old-fashioned dish, or helps himself
before me at table, em 1 to love him the less for that? What if he were to eommit
thest, or embeoezlement, or fraud? They who dedere that nu feults ατο αῑίίιο, ατο refuted
by common sense, experience, und expediency. Expediency is the parent of justice:
therefore men when they were in their first rude stete fought like beusts for their food;
but when they got civilized expediency taught them to make lews, which every one
must admit were framed to put down injustioe. Nnture' cannot draw the distinction
between right and wrongg nor will any argument convince us that a petty theft is
us bed es sacrilege. Let αι visit ench fault then with its proper meed of punishment3
that is, let us not use the scourge where the whip is only due3 for 1 have no fear of
your reversing this end substituting the whip for the scourge, though you do say you
would cut up all vices ulike if men would but make you king.

But are you not a king? Is not the wise mun rich end handsome, e eobbler und a king?
Don’t you know what your founder Chrysippus said? ‘⁶ The wise men never mede him-
selt'u ehoe in his life, yet is the wiso meu a cobbler.” How is this? Why just ns
Hermogenes is the besto? singem, even when his lips ere closed, und Alfinius continued
to be a elever shoemaker after he hed changed his trade and shut up his shop3 even so
the wiso man is the best end only workmen, und a king. And yet thou king of kings,
the little boys mob thee end pluck thy heard! To multe e long story short: while
your kingship goes down to e cheep both with no body-guard but Crispinus the block-
head, my friends shall make ellowance for my fauste, end 1 will make allowanee for
theirs, and 1 shall live es a subject more blest then you or any other king.
