Quo promissa cadant et somnia Pythagorea.
Naevius in manibus non est et mentibus haeret

Pacuvius docti famam senis, Accius alti,

ii. 4) calls ⁴ argumentatio acervalis,’ from
the Greek σωρίτης (from σω ὅς, ‘acervus,'
aheap),alogicalterm si “ ingaseriesof
propositione linked together and depending
each upon the one before it, till a conclusion
is come to which connects the first proposi-
tion with the last3 but it may go on for
ever without any conclusion at all. Persius
uses the same illustration (S. vi. 78, sqq.)=

‘⁴ Rem duplica. Feci. Jam triplex3 jam
mihi quarto ς
Jam decies redit in rugam. Depunge ubi
Inventus: Chrysippo, tui finitor acervi.”

The invention of the σωρίτης is attributed
to Chrysippus the Stoic.

48. Qut· redit in fastos] The word
‘ fiad? as applied to records, belonged pro-
perly to the sacred books or tables in which
the ⁴ fasti ¹ and ‘ nefasti dies ’ were distin-
guished, that is, the calendar. When these
were made public (Livy ix. 46) calendar-s
became common, and in these (which were
usually engraved on tables of stone) re-
markable events were inserted, so that they
became a source of historical information.
There were also consular annale, or registers
of the consuls and other chief magistrates,
kept among the records of the state, and
these were also called ⁴ fasti,’ or ⁴ annales,’
either of which words came, in consequence,
to be used generally for historical registers
of any kind, particularly by the poets.
Horace applies it to the family genealogies
of the lamia family. (C. iii. 17. 4.) See
also C. iv. 13. 153 14. 43 and S. i. 3. 112,
where it is applied in the most general way
to the history of the world.

49. Libitina] See S. ii. 6. 19, ιι.

50. Ennius et sepiem] Ennius was born
at Rudiae, in Calabria, mc. 239. ,Resides
his great historical epic poem called Annales,
and plays, and satires, he wrote philosophical
poema of which the titles of some and very
slender fragments have been preserved. He
followed the opinions of Pythagoras, and in

the beginning of his spic poem he declsred

that the spirit of Homer had passed into his

body, having meanwhile inhabited, among

others, that of a ς whence Persius

says (vi. 10):

‘⁶ Cor jubet hoc Enni, postquam destertuit
esse

Maeonides, Quintus pavone ex Pytha-

goreo ὅθ)

which means that he had woke up from his.
dream of being Homer, and, having passed
through the body of a peacock, he had be-
come Quintus Ennius. This is what Horace
alludes to in ‘ somnia Pythagorea! He says
however that Ennius need not mind what
was thought of his professions and his
dreams, since he was certainly worshipped
as if he were a second Homer. As to
⁶ oeitici' see Epp. 19. 40, n. Ennius is
called ⁸ fortis ' not for his personal bravery
(though he saw some service), but for the
boldness of his style.

53. Naevius in manibus non est] Cn.
Naevius was born about the middle of the
third century s.c., and wrote plays and an

and {nnius as one of his models3 and,
comparing these three with his own con-
temporaries, he says:

‘⁸ Quorum aemulari exoptem negligentiam

Potius quam istorum obscuram diligen-

tiam.'’ (Prol. Andria, 20, sq.)

Naevius was perhaps rather the oldest of
the three.

⁶4. Paene recens f] Bentley was the
first to make this sentence interrogative.
A few editors have declined to follow him
(Fea. Doering, and others); but 1 think he
is right. Ι can make no sense of the words
otherwise. Cicero very osten has ‘non est'
in interrogative sentences. ⁸ Paene recens’
means ‘ as if he were almost modern)
