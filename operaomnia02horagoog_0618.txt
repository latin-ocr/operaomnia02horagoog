Quam satis est morer, ex nitido fit rusticus atque

79. dum requiem, dum risus] Philip-
pus, tired with his work, refieshed himself
by getting amusement at other people’ s
expense. He gave the man a sum equiva-
lent to about 601. of our money, and offered
to lend him as much more.

91. Dur-ue —- attentusque] Philippus
means that he appears to be too hard-
working and anxious about his affairs.
Compare Β. ii. 6. 82: ‘⁸ Asper et attentus
quaesitis ;” aud Epp. i. 16. 70: “
pascat durus aretque.”

92. Pol me miserum] Gellius (xi. 6)
says, respecting oaths of this sort, that
women never swore by Hercules, ιιοι· men
by Castor, but both men and women would
swear by the temple of Pollux, ⁸ Aedepol,’
and this, he says, on the authority of Varro,
was only adopted by men in later times,
whereas it had always been used by women,
who got it from the Eleusinian myster-ies.

94. Quod te per Genium] See Epp. ii.
1. 144. This use os the relative ‘quod’
in enn3aties is common, as in Vix-gil (Aen.

The Romans believed that every man had
a genius, though their notione on the sub-
ject were very confused apparently. Ac-
cording to the name (which involves the
same element aa γέν-ωας, γί-νομαι) it
should be the attendant on a man’s birth.
as it was believed to be the inseparable
companion of his life. It represented his
spiritual identity, and the character of the
genius was the character of the man.
Varro, quoted by St. Augustius (de Civ.
Dei, vii. 13), describes the genius as‘ ‘Deus
qni praepositus est ac vim habet omnium,
rerum gignendarum3 '' and again he says

“Genium uniuscujusque animum rationa-
lem et ideo esse singulos singulorum? This
