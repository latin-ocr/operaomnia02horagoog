EPISTOLARUM I. 19.

Scripta pudet recitare et nugis addere pondu3,''
Si dixi: “ Rides,” ait, “ et J ovis auribus ista
Servas; fidis enim manare poetica mella

Te solum, tibi pulcher.”

Ad haec ego naribus uti

FormidO, et luctantis acuto ne secer ungui,

“ Displicet iste locu8,” clame, ‘⁶ et diludia posce.”
Ludus enim genuit trepidum certamen et iram,
Ira. truces inimicitias et funebre bellum.

Terence, uses this phrase (pro Coelio, c. 25)=
‘⁴ Hinc illae lacrimae nimirum, et haec causa
est horum omnium scelerum et cn‘minuml’
So Juv9enal (i. 168): ‘⁴ Inde irae et la-
cumae. ⁹

41. Spissis indique theatris] ‘⁴ Thena-a ’
here means any audience before which re-
citatione ol' this kind might take place,

though the poetry of popular writers was ¹

recited in the theatres by ⁴ mimi ’ and
⁴ mimae.

43. Jovie aur-ibus] This is the same
sort of expression as S. ii. 6. 52: “deos
quoniam propius confingis.” ⁴ Manare ’ is
not commonly used as a transitive verb.
Forcellini gives tw0 instances from Pliny.
Juvenal (vi. 623) has “longam manantia
labra salivam,” and (xv. 136) ‘⁸ cujus ma-
nantia fletum Ora puellares faciunt incerta
capilli;'’ and Ovid (Met. vi. 311) “nbi
fixa cacumine montis Liquitur et lacrimas
etiamnum marmora manant 3” in all of
which places the boet MSS. seem to be
in favour of the accusative, though many
have the ablativo. In this construction we
find the like words, ‘ flere,' ⁵ pluere,' ‘ stil-
lare‚’ ⁸ rorare,’ διο. The expressions ⁴ nu-
gis,’ ⁴ poetica mella,’ ⁴ tibi pulcher,’ all
seem to apply rather to the lyrica! com-

position3 than to the Satires. (See Intro-
uction.

45. naribus uti] See S. 6. 5, n., and Per-
sius (i.4o)= “nimis uncis Naribus indulges.”

47. diludia posca] This word occurs
no where else. Acron explains it as ⁴⁸ tem-
pora quae gladiatoribus conceduntur ut
intra dies quinque pugnent,” an interval of
five days allowed to gladiatore between
their contests. What should have suggested
this limitation it is hard to say. But the
word explains its own meaning. ‘Iste
locus' must mean the ‘pulpita ’ or ‘ spissa
theam-a ’ above mentioned. It seems as if
the speaker meant to gain time, and with·
out declining the contest made objections
to the ground, and asked for a postpone-
ment, the language of the arena or pa-
laestra being kept up. The meaning iu
plain terme is that he does not wish to be
brought into competition with others in the
way of public recitatione or criticism, be-
cause such matters, though they may begin
in good temper, generally issue in strife and
bad passione. ‘ Iste ' is better than ⁴ ine:
the reading of some MSS.. which Torrentius
prefers. It expresses ⁴ that place which you
propose ’ (u ubi ut carmina mea recitem vos
vultis? Orelli).
