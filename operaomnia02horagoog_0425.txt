of the old editions, and the received reading
in Bentley’s time was ‘ai quis! But the
Blandinian and other old MSS. have ⁴ ei
qui,' which occure above, v. 30.

86. praeco—coactor] The first of these
functionariec wae a crier either at auctions
(one of his dutiee being to induce persons
to attend and buy—aee A. P. ⁴19, “Ut
praeco ad merces turbam qui cogit emen-
das ”), 01· 111 courte of justice, or the public
assembliee. There was a ⁴praeco' at all
punishments and executione ιο declare the
crime of the offender (Epod. iv. 12,11.); also
town-eriere,who cried loct property, ae with
us. There were other kinds of crierc, re-
counted in Dict. Ant. Which class Horace
refers ιο we cannot tell. Nor ie it decided
what class of ⁴ coactores ' hic father be-
longed to. There were persone employed
by the ⁴ publicani ² ιο collect the revenue,
and who were called ⁴ coactores) The per-
con who collected the money bid et an auc-
tion was aleo a ⁴ coactor,’ and generally
a³:z⁰350ff3¹1222³zb31323205w32t0b3
of the first class made a good deal of money.
Matthew the Apostle was one, and 110 was
rich. It is generally believed that the elder
Horace belonged ιο the second of the above
cla-sees, and come colom· is given ιο this by
the association of the word with ⁴ praeco-¹
But Suetonius, or the author of Horace’s
life attributed to him, says that he was in
the employ of the ⁴ publicani! Also it ic
questioned whether he continued hie em-
ployment at Rome, or quitted it when 110
left Venusia, οι· only took ιο it at Rome,—

a point we have no meane whatever of
deciding.

87. at hoc nunc] The old editione nearly
all have ⁴ ob hoc,’ which hac very little MS.
authority, aud seems clearly ιο 110 a con-cc-
tion of copyista, who wanted a preposition
for ⁴ hoc,’ not considering the independent
use of thie word, which ie the ablative.
Acron had ⁴ ad haec ' in his copy, and
mentions another reading ⁴ ad hoc) Bentley
adopts the former in place of ⁴ ob hoc,’ which
was then the received reading. Rutgereius
mentione one MS. with ⁴ ab hoc,' from
which he extracta what, with most of the
later editore, 1 conceive ιο 110 the true
reading, ⁴ at hoc.’ ⁴ At ⁹ 111 much wanted
here, and ‘hoc,’ in the cenae of ⁴ propter
hoc,' 1πί τούτῳ, ic commonly need by
Horace. See in this Satire, v. 41, ⁴⁴ Hoc
tibi Paullus et Messalla videris ?'' aud v. 52,
⁴⁴ Felicem dicere 11011 hoc me posmm.'' It
is also common in caesar. ⁴ At hoc' ia the
reading of Aldue' edition of 1501, Orelli's
St. Galle MS.. and two mentioned by Fea
in the Vaticen library. An the Blandinians
had ⁴ ob hoc,' and two of the Berne ⁴ ad hoc-²

89. Nil me poeniteat mum] ⁴ 1 hope
while 1 have my senece 1 may never be
aehamed.’ Horace urea this mode of ex·
pressiori elsewhere, as in the last Satire, v.
44, ⁴⁴ Nil ego contulerim jucundo canus
amico.” S. ii. 3. 322, ⁴⁴ Quae ei quie nnus
fecit sanun facis et tu.'’

90. dolo] Fon-cell. does not notice thia
use of ⁴ dolus! It ie used like ⁴ ἕποι’ 111
C. i. 28. 30, ‘⁴ Negligis immeritis nocituram
postmodo te genitis fraudem committere,”
for a fault generallyt ⁴ dolo suo' by his own
fault.

9³. Et vox ct ratio .·]

⁴ My language
and my judgment.’
