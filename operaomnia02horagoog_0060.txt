Horace may hsve remembered the words of
Pindn· (Nem. viii. 4o)= αὔξεται δ’ ἀρετὰ
χλωραῖς ἐέρσαις ὡς ὅτε δένδρεον ᾄσσει.
⁸ Occulto sevo' means by su imperceptible
guorth, ss Ovid, Met. x. 519: ‘³ Labitur
occulte fallitque volatilis setas.” As the
nume of Marcellus (whom 1 understand with
Onnitobe the Marcellus whotook Syru
cuse) stnuds for nll his family, and porticu
hrlythe young Marcellus (see Introduction),
sothe stsrof Juliuscwm sudthe leesor

lighoe of that family m meent by whst sol-
lows. Those who suppose Marcellus to be
the ‘ Julium Sidus, relying upon Ovid
(Tr. ii. 167) calling Drusus sud Germani-
cus ‘ Sidus juvenile,’ sud Fabius ⁴ Fabiae
sidus geutis' (ex Ponto, iii. 3. 2), forget that
he never was adopted into the J ulisu family.
By it is meunt Caesar himself, st whose
death ns is well known s comet is reported
to hsve appeared, which vus supposed to
be his spirit translated to the skies. (See
Suet. J. C. 883 ovid, Met. xv. sub fin.)
Addisou (Dialogues on Medulis, 2) mentions
a med-l struck in honour of Augustus in
the reign of 'ribei-Ius, iu which he is repre·
sented with Csesur's ster testing on his
head according to that desmiption of virgil
(Aen. viii. 68⁰):

— “ geminas cui tempore flammas

Iacetis vomunt patriumque aperitur vertice

si us.”
