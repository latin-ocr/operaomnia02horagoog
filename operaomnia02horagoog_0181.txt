HORATII FLAGGI

25

Damnum: neque amissos colores
La'na refert medicata ἰιιοο,
Nec vera virtus cum semel excidit

Curat reponi deterioribus.

30

Si pugnat extricata densis
Cerva plagis erit* ille sortis
Qui perfidis se credidit hostibus,
Et Marte Poenos proteret altero

Qui lora restrictis lacertis

35

Sensit iners timuitque mortem.
Hic unde vitam sumeret inscius

Pacem duello miscuit.

Ο pudor !

Ο magna Karthago, probrosis

Altior Italiae ruinis !

26. Flayitio additis Damnum .·] Franks
suggests that it may hsve been propooed
to purchese the liberty of the prisoners.
Horace’s words ιιι-ο ⁴ ye ere adding mischief
to disgrsce ς’ snd from what follows it
would seem thst the mischief would ariae
from having among them again those who
had sunk so low. The words ere like those
of Euripides (Rhes. 102),

αἰσχρὸν γὰρ ἡμῖν καὶ πρὸς αἰσχύνῃ

κακον.

30. reponi deterioribus] This hes some-
times been translated ss if Horace meent
thet true virtue would not suffer itself to be
replaced by false, or virtue of s lower sort.
Ι rather think he means thet true virtue,
when it hes once been lost, does ,not cere
to be restored to the degenerste. So the
Scholiasta understood it. ‘⁸ Excidit: sci-
licet animis. Curat reponi: i. e. restitui
ipsis animis deterioribus, i. e. minus bonis
quam prius.’' (Porph.) Acron gives the
seme explanation, end notices the opposite
statement οἱ Vin-gil (Aen. ii. 367) 2-

“ Quo-{idern etiem victis redit in praecordis
vt us.

Orelli adopts this interpretation.

33. Qm· perfidis se credidit haustum]
Bentley conjectures ⁴ dedidit ’ destroying
the force of the words ‘ he who has trusted
himself to sn enemy not to be trusted ;’ es

C. iii. 27. 25,—

“ Sic et Europe niveum doloso
Credidit tauro latus?

where the opposition is the seme. Bentley’s
usual method of erguing down s received
reading, by citing passages from otherwriters
where his own word occurs, is s mere waste
of labour. Any number of passages in
which ⁴ hostibus κω dedere ⁹ msy occur,
will not prove against sll the MSS„ the
character of the sentence derived from the
epithet ⁴ perfidis,' sud the pmnel passage
I have quoted, thst Horace here wrote ⁸ de·
didit‚' which signifies sn uncouditionnl snr-
render without reference to the perfidy or
good saith of the enemy. (See nrt. Dedi·
ticii, Smith’s Dict. Ant.)

3¹7. Hic unde vitam] ⁶ He ι’. e. the
cowsrd), not considering to what e ought
to owe hie lise (ι’. e. to his own sword, ⁴ uns
selus victis,’ Aen. ii. 354), confouuds pesce
with war :’ thet is to say, makes for
himself on the field of battle. Bentley’s
munis for slterntion lesds him into s very
great one here. In s few MSS. he finds
the reading ⁴ aptius ’ for ‘ inscius,' sud this
lesda him to correct the whole passage thus,
timuitque mortem

Hinc, unde vitam sumeret aptius ς
Pacem et duello miscuit-,²²

 

where the ⁴ hinc ' and ‘ et ² sre his own in-
ventione, snd the punctuation is also his own.

40. Altior Italiae ruinis Ι] On v. 62 of
the lest ode was quoted from Ovid (Fut.
iii. 441) “ Pelion altior Osss,” ⁶ Pelion
raised upon the head of Ossa.) So hene is
meent Carthago rsised above the ruins of
Italy, sud looking down upon them.
