functione of thet goddess. ⁶ Commotus ’ is
used for different degrees of mental excite-
ment. See v· 2⁰9, where the meaning is
the seme ss here, ⁴ med! Agrippina, who
was os a temper, is called ⁴ commotior ⁹
by Tacitus tiAnn. i. 33). ⁴ Cognata voes-
buls ³ means words which may differ in
sound, but ere one in sense. ‘⁴ Dives-ss

tantist (Auum). The editors ere not sil

281. Libertina: erat,] The next folly
notieed is superstition. Stertinius tells, by
way of illustration, s story of en old ‘ liber·
tinus, ' who went from shrine to shrine

erected in the ⁴ compitsss spots where two .

or more streete met, prsying to the Lares
Compitales (sor whom alters were built in
such lsoes; see above, v. 26, n.) thst they
woul gmnt him immortnhty. This he did
early in the morning, quite sober, end with
hands weshed ss beeeme s serious wor-
shipper. Now this men was sound in hesr-
iug sud sight, but, says Stertinius, if his
former mester had ever wanted to part with
him, in puttiug him up for sale hewould heve
cautioned purchasers thet he wss not in his
right mind, unless he wanted to get into sn
action to rescind the bargain on the ground
of fraud. It was n for e person
selling s slave to inform the buyer of sny
bodily or mental desset in him. See Cicero
de Off. iii. 17 ε “ In mancipiorum ven·
ditione venditoris fraus omnis excluditur:
qui enim seire debuit de ssnitste, de fug-s, de
furtis praestet edicto Aedilium.” See also
Dig. 21, Tit. 1: “Qui mancipis vendunt
eerfiores sedent emptores quid morbi vitiive
cuique sit, quis fugitivus errove sit, noxave
solutum non sit: eademque omnis cum es.
mancipis venibunt pelam reete pronun-
ciante. Quod si mancipium adversus es
