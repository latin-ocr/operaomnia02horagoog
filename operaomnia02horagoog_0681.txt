656 HORATII FLAOGI

are common3 but the fact is it hus more difficulty became it has len indulgmee. Don't
you see how elever Plautus is in rakiah youths, stingy fathers, tticksy δοκὼ.) How
great is Dossennus in parasitos, and how slip·shod he wana over the stage? All he
entes for is to put money in his ρωπος while those who take to wn‘ting for fame riso
und fau with the mere caprice of the spect-tor. Forewell the stage for me, is opphnse
is ιο make me fat and the refusal of ἰι leun. The boldeet poet is sometimes discou-
eeroed when the mob in the middle of the play eall for beers and bozen. And even
the edueeted have turned to shows ς for hom-s the mrtnin is down sor the exhibition of
processione end beatu, such es would make Demea-itus longh, not ot the soene but
the spectatore. As to the noise thot goes on in the thau-es, the forest· of Gngnnnm
ond the rou-ing of the see are nothing to it. And what is it all about ἓ nu the ωιοι·
spoken ? Not o word. They ure applauding his fine clothes!

(v. 208.) But lest you should think 1 bestow but grudging pruine on on nrt Ι cannot
praetia, Ι declaro there is nothing that man is not espoble of, in my opinion, who cun
move my soul with fiction and magieinn-like tmnsport me from phos to phoe-

(v. 214.) But Ι prey you bestow some patu-onage on those who write, not for epea-ton
but for realem so shall you worthily fin Apollo’s libras-y, ond give us poeta ι spur of
encourogement, though we do a gmt many wrong things 1 must ndmit; for instnnee,
when we intrude upon you out of sensnm nre offended ιι being told of e blemish3 repent
our verses ognin sud again without being asked3 mourn that our difficulties ne not
appreciatum expect you to send for us insunuy, and bid us write, ond make our for-
tunes. But we ought ιο consider who is worthy to be enta-usted with the reeording of
such virtues. Choerilus got gold from Alexander for his wretched vex-een but meh,
like ink, only stain the deeds they profess ιο pruine. Alexnnder judged better when he
ordered thet none should paint him but Apelles, or make his statue but Lysippus.
But in the matter of poetry his teste was Boeotisn. Vis-gil ond Varius do no disgreoe
ιο your generosity3 and no stowe ever expressed the fece of heroes more vividly thau the
poet's croft their souls. Much rather would 1 sing of your noble deedsg of conquered
lande, aud rivers, and losty heights‚ and barbarian renlms3 of peuce restored und Pur-
thians terrified, if what 1 would 1 could. But Ι may not venture beyond my oneng-th.
Officiousness often stupidly toi-ments the object of its love, especidly when it is nllied
with verse. Men easily remember what gives them mirth, and for my part 1 bave no
mind for such oppressive attentione. Ι don't 'ish ιο heve my features muniet-ed in n
bust of wax, or ιο be celebrated in olumsy verse, lest 1 be ammiod out along with my
poet like a eoi-pse on the poor mnn's bier, and consignet] with him to his tomb in the
groeer's shop.
