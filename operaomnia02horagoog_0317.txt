292 HORATII FLAOCI

CARMEN VII.

This ode is referred by Franke, Kirchner (p. 22), Mitscherlich‚ and others, to sanc.
722, when the last war between Augustus and Μ. Antonius broke out. Orelli, on the
other hand, refers it to the beginning of the war of Perusia, amc. 713-14, to which
period Epode xvi. belongs. Dillenbr. refers it, without assigning any particular
reasons, to the year 716, when Augustus was going against Sex. Pompeius. There is
very little, if any, internal evidence as to the date. None of the chronologists give any
good reason for their opinions, and the reader must judge for himself.

ARGUMENT.

Whither run ye to arms ?—hath not blood enough of Romans been shed? ’Tis not to
burn the walls of Carthago, or humble the Briton, but that the Parthian may rejoice in
seeing Rome fall by‘her own hand. The beasts do not war upon their kind. Is it
madness, or force irresistible, or wickedness that drives you? They are dumb: they

answer not. 'Tis even so = the blood of Remus is visited on the destinies of Rome.
