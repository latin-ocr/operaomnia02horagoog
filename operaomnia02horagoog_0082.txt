CARMINUM Ι. 25. 57

CARMEN XXV.

Resides this thero are two other odes (iii. 15. iv. 13), the subjectos which is tho mion-
nou· os Μαι beautieo, a subject probably handled with stin greater pungency by Archile-
chus, for it m ono his summ would find soope in and would be likely to fasten upon.
lt is imponible to say whether Horace had any individunl in his mind when he wrote any
one of these odes. If he had, we need not go tartha and suppose that be wrote as a dis-
appointed lover. For instance. J ani's indignation ot the virulenoe with which Hormo eun
find it in his heu-t to attsck (in C. iv. 13) the woman be was so fond of (in C. iii. 10),
seems to be unneoemry. But it is a fair specimen os that matter-of-foet school of intor-
pretstion. 1 bave before had occasion ω remu-k, how the some principle is applied to
1,χῶ and how many new lights she appears in (C. 18. Introduction).

ARGUMENT.

Thy vindows are no longer „sailed and thy slnmbors broken by sancy youths3 thy
door turns no more on its hinges; the serenade is silent. Now ’tis thy turn, in some
lone olley on s dnk night, with the winter wind blowing and thy beart on firo with

lust, to cry for lovers, and comphin that young blood goes nster the tenden- piant and
bida the old leaves go fluet upon the Hebrus.
