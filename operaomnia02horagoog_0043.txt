ARGUMENT.

The winter is thswing3 the spring is returning3 the ships arebeing lsunchedg the her-ds
quit their stalis und the ploughman his fireside, and the meadows ure no longer white
with fiost. Venus end the Greces are leading the danos. and the Cyclops' forge is
hurning. Let us bind the head with myrtle or the earth's first flowers, end sacrifice
e lamb or kid to Pan. Desth cells on rich end poor aliine. Life is short, Ο Sestius!

end our hopes we must contract- The greve swaits thee, md when there no more
:halt thou preside at feast or sigh for the fair young Lycidas.

SoLvrrun acris hiems grata vice veris et Favoni,
Trahuntque siccas machinae carinae,

Ac neque jam stabulis gaudet pecus aut arator igni ;
Nec prata canis albicant pruinis,

J unctaeque Nymphis Gratiae decentes

Alter-no terram quatiunt pede, dum graves Cyclopum
Volcanus ardens urit officinas.

7. qraves] This epithet may heve a
variety of meaning-s, and esch editor gives
his own version. Perhaps Horace meent
⁸ labor-icus! The eruptions of Aetne, where
the thunderbolts of Jove were supposed to
be forged, taking place chiefly in the sum-
mer snd early autumn, the Cyclops are fitly
represented ss prepnring these bolts in
spring. See Cic. de Divin. ii. 19: ⁸⁸ Non

fabricatos esse Cyclopas in Aetne pntes.”

sense for ⁸ uro.' Rutgersius therefore pre·
ferred the reading ⁸ visit,’ which occurs in
some MSS. of high character. He quotes
Apollon- Rhod. iii. 41 ι

where there is certainlys resemblance to this
passage of Horace, but not strong enough
to make it probabis he had it in his me-
mory when he wrote this ode. By s rather
remarkable coincidence Bentley appears to
heve hit upon these lines of Apollonius, and
to heve made them a part of his argument
for ⁸ visit,⁸ without knowing that Rntger-
sius, with whose notes he was familiar, had
done the seme before him. Scaliger pro-
posed ⁸ urget,’ which is further from the
true reading than ⁸ visit,' between which
