INTRODUGTION. xv

that time continued to be his patron and friend. There is nothing
more genuine in Horace’s writings than his expressions of affection for
his father and for Maecenas. His gratitudo to the latter never takes
the form of servility, his affection never savours of affectation, and his
familiarity never approaches to impertinence. He sees in Maecenas’
gista to himself only the genereus disposition of the giver, of which he
has no thought of taking undue advantag03 his patronage he neither
exaggerates nor undervalues; for his health he feela tenderly; his
danger he tries to ahai-03 and his anxieties he does his best to soothe.
It is evident that Maecenas valued his society and understood his
character.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio and the
many persons of consideration whose friendahip he appears to have
enjoyed. Through Maecenas also it is probable Horace was introduced
to Augustae, but when that happened is uncertain. In A.U.o. ‘717
Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to meet M. Antonius at Brundi-
sium, and he took Horace with him on that journey, of which a detailed
account is given in the fifth Satire of the first book. Horace appears
to have parted from the rest of the company at Brundisium, and per-
haps returned to Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. i. 5, Int.).
Between this journey and amc. ‘7 22 Horace received from his friend
the present of a small estate in the valley of the Digentia (Licenza),
situated about thirty-four miles from Rome, and fourteen from Tibur, in
the Sabine country. of this property he gives a description inhis Epistle
to Quintius (i. 16), and he appears to have lived there a part of every year,
and to have been fond of the place, which was very quiet and retired, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), a municipium per-
haps, but not a place of any importance. During thia interval he con-
tinued to write Satires and Epodes, but also, it appears to me probable,
some of the Odes, which some years later he published, and others which
he did not publish. These compositions I have no doubt were seen by
his friends, and were pretty well known before any of them were collected
for publication. It will be seen from the separate Introductions to the
several Satires of the first book that there is not one which might not
have been written by the year AALO. 719, and in that year Franke
supposes the first book was published. It may have been so, but
, Franke’s arguments are not conclusive. In ΛΑΜ). ’723 the battle of
Actium was fought, and in the prospect of Maecenas having a command
on that occasion, Horace wrote him a touching poem, which stands first
in the book of Epodes. The ninth Epode was written immediately
aster the victory, and there is no poem in the book of Epodes which
need be placed later. I agree therefore with Franks in thinking that
