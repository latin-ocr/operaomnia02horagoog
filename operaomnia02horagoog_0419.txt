24. Quo tibi, Tillffl The Scholiasta
Aaron and Comm. Cruq. say that this
person, whose name is Tunius in some
MSS. and editions, was a senator, and was
degraded by Julius Caesar as being of Pom-
&mm Effissh‘hi‘mh‘ssffmfflffiffffiffi
tribune. One of caem’ s amusim was
'hilline Cimber, and it has been supposed—
Ι do not know on what grounds—that this
man was his brother. whether or ιιο he
is different from the person mentioued
below, v. 107, it is not easy to say. Est-»6
denies, Orelli and others affirm, that he is
the same. There is not much to guide us.
Each legion' ιιι the Roman army (the num·
ber varied at different times, but at Philippi
there were nineteen on each side, each
legion consisting os about 6000 men, rather
less than more) had six tribunes (the post
Horace held in Brutus' army), who were
their priucipal officers. The military tri-
bunes of the four first legions were entitled
to sitin the senate. (See Epod. 4. 15, ιι.)
Aa to the ‘latus οΙιιιιιε,ν see note on the
34th verse of the last Satira. ‘Qum’ ⁸ to
what purpose) (SeeC. ii. 2. 9, ιι.)

27. Nam 'ut quisque insanus] ἸῚιο
senators’ ‘sscalceus an out door ehoe, was
sastened by four thonge, two on each side,
which went s pirally up to the eslf of the
leg (medium crus). These thongs were
called· corrigiae,' and were black. The
ehoe itself appears to have varied' ιιι colour.
Juvenal (vii. 192) says of Quintilianus:
‘⁴ appositam nigrae lunam Subtexit alutae,”
where the ‘ aluta ’ is a ehoe made of leather
sostened in a solution of alum, and its
oolour is black. It also hears something in
the shape of a crescent ‘luna’ (Ruperti says
a buckle), which Philostratus (Vita Herod.
ii. 8) calls σύμβολον τῆς εὐγενείας-ἐπι-
σφύρων (it must therefore have been worn
as high as the ancle) ’Modus-‹vot› μηνόειδες.

Martial calls it‘ ‘lunata pellis” (i. 50. 31),
and again (ii. 9. 7, sq.):

“Non hesterna sedet lunata lingula planta,
(ἶοᾶιὲιιαιλιιιυ non laesum cingit aluta pe·

where the shoe is purple or dark red. Such
a ahoe was the ⁸ mulleos) Becker supposes
this to have been the invariable colour, and
that Juvenaw nigrae 'must refer, as this
passage of Horace clearly does, only ω the
stringe. (Gallus, Exc. ‘Male attim') Is
so, the string was of the same leather as
the shoe, and passed over the‘ luna: which
was perhaps on the outcr side of the foot.

29. Quis homo laic eet? quo] The
MSS. vary between this reading and‘ hic,
et quo ’and ‘hic, aut quo! The editors
differ. The reading 1 have followed (after
Lambinus, Orelli, and others) seems well
suited to the sort of remark and question
supposed.

30. quo morbo Barrus] His dbease
was a thirst for admiration among women.
He is said by the Scholiasts Porphyrion and
Comm. Cruq. to have been a man of the
worst passione, and to have committed in·
cest with Aemilia, a Vestal virgin. ‘⁸ Certe
adulteras sincerissima cupiditate sectabatur ”
Porphyrion says, in a tone which shows
he had some known person in his mind.
But Aemilia was found guilty of incest,
together with two other Vestals, Marcia and
Licinia, Α. ιι. c. 6⁴0. (Liv. Epit. 63.) Plu-
tarch mentions the circumstance (Qua-st.
Rom. 80), and says that among the persons
accused was one Βουτέτιος βάρβαρος,
which Fabricius has corrected into Βετού-
τιος Βαρῤος, Betutius Barrus, which no
doubt is the correct reading. The Scholiasts
in all probability had read of this Barrus,
and confounded Horace's coxcomb with
him. There was one of this family who
was a distinguished provincial orator in
Cicero’s time. mentioned hy him in his
Brutus (c. 46). The name, therefore, is a
real one, but it does not follow that Horace
might not mean somebody of a different
name. Orelli assumes him to be the same
aethe person mentioned in S. 4. 110 as
reduced to poverty‚ and adds, ubefore he
was so reduced he was an immoderate
dandy and a licentious fellow,” which is a
little too dogmatical iu a matter so uncer-
tain. There is no similarity between the
