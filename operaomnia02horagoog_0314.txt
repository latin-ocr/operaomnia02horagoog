Maius parabo, maius infundam tibi

Fastidienti poculum,

Priusque caelum sidet inferius mari,

Tellure porrecta super,

Quam non amore sic meo flagres uti
Bitumen atris ignibus. —
Sub haec puer jam non ut ante mollibus

Lenire verbis impias,

Sed dubius unde rumperet silentium

Misit Thyesteas preces:

Venena magnum fas nefasque non valent
Convertere humanam vicem3

Diris agam vos; dira detestatio

Nulla expiatur victima.

Quin ubi perire jussus exspiravere

86. Thyesteas preces. ·] Curses such as
Thyestes might have imprecated on the
head of Atreus. The opening sentence of
the boy’ s speech is variously interpreted.
Lambinus pro ‚ and many scholare
have adopted, the following version. namely,

“Witchcrast can overthrow the great prin·
gp& «Ξῖ Ξζεᾱαι, gitti: cannotfptzertlfirow (qr

ge e con on or ο men,

where ‘'valent is understood in the first
clause. In support of the construction are
quoted Tac. Ann. xii. 642 “Agrippina
quae filio dare imperium, tolerare imperi-
tantem nequibat.” Ib. xiii. 56: “Deesae
nobis terrain qua vivamus, in qua moriamur
non potest;” and Plaut. Amphit. i. 1. 300:
44 Tuae si quid vis nuntiare §suh sinam) hanc
nostram adhuc non sinam;’ which no doubt
exactly represent the case as these inter·
preters view it. But 1 do not see the sense
which by this construction is brought out of
Horace’s words. Orelli makes 4 fas ne-
fasque ’ the subject, and supposes the boy
to say that appeals to justice and the laws
of Heaven are of no avail ιο turn the course
of witchcraft (or the hearts of witches); so
he resorts to curses. The words 4 humanam
vicem' he renders 4 more modoque homi-

num,' which he explains by ‘humanis sensi-

bus! But what he means is not clear. It
would be better if this view of the construc-
tion were adopted to render ‘ humanam
vicem'‘ on behalt' of men, ' or ‘of humauity, ’
:1⁸AE ’ἓξὲξ ἓωιῗῗῑῖὲὲἕΕΡᾏς) ⁰‘.’³‡¹33?12¹?3¹33
1 do not see why⁴ venena’ should not
stand for‘ veneficas,’ like‘ scelus’ for‘ sce-

lestus,’ as Fea says, but which Dillenbr.
says cannot be. Bentley acknowledges he
can make nothing of the sentence3 and, as
the corrections he suggests do not plesse
himself, they need not be repeated here.
The Scholiasts throw no light upon the
subject with their explanatione, and 1 feel
very doubtful about the meaning. ΤΙιο
words may be translated as they stand:

“Witchcrast or the great powers of right
and wrong cannot change the fate of men ;''
i. e. nothing can, whether it be good or bad;
and though that interpretation does not
satisfy me, Ι prefer it to the others, because
it ia the least strained with reference to the
collocation of the words. The omission of
a copula between 4 venena’ and 4 magnum'
is no argument against this version. The
only other explanation that coincides at all
with the order of the words is that which
makes 4 magnum fas nefasque ' an exclama·
tion: 44 Witchcraft, by the mighty lawa of
heaven! cannot change the destiny of man.”
To this interpretation Orelli pays no more
attention than to say 44 prorsus imperite
nuper interpres quidam fas nefasque pro
mera exclamatione habuitss’ It had oc-
curred to me as a possible solution of the
difficulty; and, notwithstanding Orelli’ s
opinion, 1’ think it may take its place among
the more plausible of the many explanatione
that have been offered. Orelli has given
every other that has been suggested, in his
excursus on the passage.
