HORATII· FLACGI

Troum belli scriptorem, maxime Lolli,

2. Dum tu declamas Romae] Horace
writes to Lollius ss to one familiar with
Homer’s poems. He says of himself, re-
{tininga to his)= early educntion et Iiome

masters before they put on the ⁶ toga virilis,'
end there they lesrnt to declsim upon sub-
jecte given them from history, of which s
bitter description is given by Juvenal (vii.

150, sqq., · seeslsox. 167).

This practice was not introduced tin the later
years of the republic. As late as A.u.c. 662
the censore Cn. Domitius Aenobarbus and
Ι... Licinius Crassus issued this edict: ‘⁴ Re-
nuntiatum est nobis esse homines qui novum
genus disciplinae instituerunt: sd quos ju-
ventus in ludos conveniat: eos sibi nomen
imposuisse Latinos Rbetorssz ibi homines
adolescentulos totos dies desidere. Majom
nostri ’quse liberos suos discere, et quos in
ludos itere vellent, instituerunt. Haec nove
quse praeter consuetudinem ec morem me-
jorum fiunt, neque placent, neque recte
videntur. Quapropter et iis qui eos ludos
hebent, et iis qui eo venire consueverunt,
videtur faciendum ut ostendamus nostram
sententiam, nobis ιιοιι placere ” (Sueten. de
Rhet. c. 1), which will serve for a good
instance of educationsl bigoti-y. The prec-
tice of decluiming with an instructor did not
cesse when boys left school. They hed
teschers et home. Lollius no doubt hed
one. (See Introduction.)

—- Praeneste releyn' ,·] Praeneste (Pales-

trins) was in Iastium, sbout twenty-three
miles due esst of Reme, on the edge of the
Apennines. 1t was ιι cool retreat, to which
Horace appears sometimes to hsve gone in
summer, even when he hed s place of his
own elsewhere. See C. iii. 4. 21, sqq.:

‘⁴ — vester in arduos
Tollor Sabinos, seu mihi frigidum
Praeneste seu Tibur supinum
Seu liquidae placuere Beise.”
It suffered greatly from the melty of Sulla
for sheltering· the younger Marius, but
estet-werde recovered itself and bec-me a
place of fsshionsble resort for the sake of
its climate, which Strabo notices (v. Ρ. 365).
Juvenal cells it‘ ‘gelida Praeneste” (ἰὶι.
190), end couples it with Tibur end other
places as s retreat from the disturbsuces of
Reme, and he speaks of one Centronius,
who built villas

‘⁴ modo curvo

Littore Caietae, summa nunc ‘liburia erce.

Nunc Praenestinis iu montibus, altu persbet

culmine villarum, Graecis longeque petitis

Marmor-ihm, vincens Fortunae etque Her-
culis sedem.'' (xiv. 86, sqq.)

There must therefore hsve been some fine
houses there, for the temple of Fortune tt
Praeneste was ιι hmdsome building3 sud
Sulla, by wey of making up to the in-
habitants for his berberity, besutified this
temple very much. He placed in it the
first mosaic pevement known in Itely.
