were well own to Cicero, who speaks of
him as “vafer ille Siculus Epicharmus”
(ad Att. i.19); “astutus nec insulsus
homo'' Disp- i. 8). Aristotle (Poet.
c. 5) says that Epicharmus and Phor-mis
were the first inventore of comedy. Bentley
(Epp. of Phalaris, p. 199) takes the fact to
be that the comedies of Epicharmus were
the first that were written.

received the name of Statius (⁴ ‘Statius autem
servilenomen fuit‚” Gell. iv. 20, where he is
giving an account of Caecilius), and when he
recovered his freedom he retained this name
as a cognomen: “Sed postea versum est
quasi in cognomentum appellatusque Cae-
cilius Statius.” He died amc. 586, the
year after Ennius. His contemporaries
held him in high estimation. According to
the text of Suetonius' life of Terence as it
now stands, Caecilius was the person ιο
whom Terence was dmcted by the Aediles

Alae inthe canon, as it is called, of Volcatius

Polymetis, p. ll, sq.) upon Terence, which
1 should think represents the opinion of his
sensible contemporaries. It appears to me
very just as far as it guaz—‘⁶ We may see
by that (the Eunuchus) and the rest of his
plays which remain ιο us to what a degree
of exactness and elegance the Roman comedy
was arrived in his time. There is a beauti-
ful simplicity which reigns through all his
works. There is no searching after wit, and
no ostentation of ornament in him. All his
speakers seem ιο say just what they should
say and no more. The storyis always going
on, andgoes ou just asitought. This
wh’ole age, long before Terenceg and long
after, is rather remarkable for strength than
beauty in writing. The Roman language
itself in his hands seems tobe improved be·
yond what one could ever expect. end ιο be
advanced almost a hundred years forwerda·
than the fimes he lived in. ’⁹ This he ac·
counts for by his intercourse with laelius
and Scipio, byy both of whom Terence was
su ιο have been assisted in wn’ting
his plays. “lieet Terentii scripta ad Scipi-
onem Africanum referantur, quae temen
sunt in hoc genere elegantissima'’ (Quintil.
x.l. 100.
propter el)egantiam sermonis putabantur a
C. laelio stu-ibi” (Cic. ad Att. vii. 3).
Donatus, ιιι his life of Terence, quotes the
authorities of Q. Memmius, the orator, and
Nepos for the same fact, and he himself
alludes to it as a matter cast ιιι his teeth by
his adversaries, but as one οι· which, if ιι
were true, he should have more reason ιο
be prond 'than ashamed. See Prologus to '
Adelph. and Heautont. But there is no
patchwork in Terence's plays. No help he
could have hed from any oue would account
for the uniform elegance οιῗ lauguage, pathos,
teste, wit, and humorous pictur-es of
real life and nature, that appear throughout
his writings. Afranius (in Suetonius’ life,
c. 5) says, ‘⁸ Terentio non similem dices
quempiam.” There are few like him now.
His name was P. Terentius Afer. He was
a slave in the family of one P. Terentius
Lucanus, whose praenomen and gentile
name he took on his manumission, retain·
ing as a cognomen the name which he de-
rived from the place of his birth, Carthage,
if the accounts we have of his life be cor-
rect. The plays we have of his are all ‘ pal-
liatae' derived more or lesa from the Greek,
chiefly of Menander.
