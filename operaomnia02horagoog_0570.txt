LIBER PRIMUS. .

EPISTLE Ι.

Some time aster Horace had published 1118 three books of Odee, and had. 88 11 appears,

begged him to return to it. That 18 1118 obvious meaning of the remonstrance with which
the Epistle opens. He expresses 811 88111881 111811 10 181118 11110 primey, to abendon
poetry, and to devote himself 10 1118 etudy of philosophy. He disdaime all connexion with
secte, and 1110188888 111 811 humilsty, but not without some irony, to ronow 1118 01111 crude
notione 88 8 111818 beginner3 1118 hope and purpose, he says, 18 to carry virtue into active
practice, 88 11181 which ‘⁴ Aeque pauperibus prodeat, locupletibus aeque ;'’ he recommends
it 88 the panacea of life, 88 1118 only true wiadom3 he looks upon the world 88 a shnffling

life bad not been me from many vexatione, arising out of the jealouaies 1118 popularity 81111

the world 1188 sincere in wishing 1ο get away from it; that he 1188 111811 of a reputation
which brought him into trouble; and that he was weary of writing verses to express a
passion 118 never heartily felt and 1188 811111888 likely to feel in 'his forty-fifth year. He
did return to ode writing⁹ 88 118 know, and wrote 801118 of 1118 beet 181888 (but not 1118
