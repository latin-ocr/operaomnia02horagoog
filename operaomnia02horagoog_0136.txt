that he had not then received his new usme3 but that is no argument, for he is so called
in later odes (iii. 14. 3; iv. 2. 48). Propertius had this ode in his mind probably
when he wrote his elegy to Maecenas (ii. 18). The brother (by adoption) of Terentia
was, as we have seen (C. ii. 10), Licinius Murena, who by adoption was called A
Terentius Varro Murena. The Scholiasts, as mentioned above, mil Licymnia, ‘ Licinia!
whether we may infer from Murena's name that Terentia was also ealled Licinia, as
Danier says, is doubtful, and yet it corresponds so nearly ιο the neme Horace has chosen
that it seems very likely she was. The langnage may appear to modern taste rather too
familiar in speaking οἰ his patron and his patron's wife. On the orthography of Licymnia,
see Wagner on Virg. Aen. ix. 546: ‘⁸ Maeonio regi quem serva Licymnia fan-tim?

ARGUMENT.

Do not ask me with my sost lyre to sing of bloody wars, of centaurs, and of giants: as
for the triumphs of Caesar, Maecenas, thou eouldest tell them better in prose than 1
in verse. My tssk is to sing of the beauty and faithfulness of Licymnia, who graees
the danee and sports with the damsels on Diana’s holiday. Wouldst thou for all the
wealth of Persia, Phrygia, and Arabia give a look of Licymnia’s hair or the kim she
refuses but loves thee to snstch, and will sometimes snataeh before thee?

So τε often follows οὔτε, the fact being that
every negative proposition may be resolved
into an affirmative with a negation. Here
the connexion is between ⁴ nebis’ and ⁴ di-
ces! Orelli is of opinion, and argues it
strongly, that ⁴ tu’ is to be taken generally
sor any body, not as referring to Maecenas
or any intention of his to write an account
of Augustus’ wars, which it is generally as-
sumed he either executed or contemplated.
