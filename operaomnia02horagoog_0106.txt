OARMINUM I. 36.

Neu promptae modus amphorae,
Neu morem in Salium sit requies pedum,

Neu multi Damalis meri

Bassum Threicia vincat amystide,

Neu desint epulis rosae,

Neu vivax apium, neu breve lilium.
Omnes in Damalin putres
Deponent oculos, nec Damalis novo

Divelletur adultero

Lascivis hederis ambitiosior.

and Muttini (xii. 34) writing to his kineman
ιιγι that of the thirty-four years of their
intercourse the greater number had been

And Catullus exclnime in joy nt Lesbia’ ι
return to him: 44 Ο Lucem candidiore notul⁷⁷
(cvii. ad Lesbiam). Horace only uses
⁴ Cressn' (the adjective of ⁴ eret& chnlk, ιο
mlled ιι coming from Cimolus, ιι emnil
island nent Crete), where Catullm and the
other· meite equit-alent ⁴ eandida! Grae-
vius adopted the notion of Harduin (on the
above passage of Pliny), who takes· Οιοιιιι

(C. ιι. 3. 8. S. i. 10. 24), ‘Creten wine!
Bentley wne not owni-e that his friend hed
pun-onina this interpretation, which he
satisfactorily dispones of by showing that
Cretan wine was nothing more than ⁴ pne-
sum,’ a sweet'liqueur made of misine.

12. Neu morem in Salium] ⁴ Snlium⁷
is en adjective like 4 Μία-ιε’ in the next
ode. Orelli hesitating between adjective
und substantive contradicts himself in his
note· in thie place and C. iv. Ι. 28, where it
occurs again. See note.

13. multi Damam meri] Such ie the
ffiffffna {¹13¹ss 2¹:11⁶& 3³2,szssss ἐξ.
nme words. “Eurylocumque simul, mul-
tique' Elpenora vini) And Cicero (nd Fam.

rightly interprete ⁴ magnae pecnniee⁷ by

‘pecuniosum’ It appears from inscrip-
tione that Damalis was a neme common
among freedwomen (Eutre, p. 481). Who
Bassus wne, we cannot tell without knowing

tion). Martia! mentione ι Benene, who
according to his severe insinnnlion might

Miffifflifoii Bassi filia pot-t equam, ⁷⁷

where the name ie probably fiotifious, but
it may heve been proverbial. That, however,

it may have become from this verse of
Horace. There cen be little doubt, however,

that Βιιιιιι wns a real ιι und a friend
of the soldier whose return was to be cele-
brated. Damalis may be any body—n
woman like Lyde (C. ii. ll. 22), brought
into the ode to make up ιι scene.

14. Threicia vincat amystide] ‘Amyclis’

breath or closing the li (ἀ, μύειν). Aris-
