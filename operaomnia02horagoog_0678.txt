EPISTLE Ι.

Axona other anecdotes connected with Augustus, Suetonius, in his life of Horace,
says, ‘⁴ Post Sermones quoque lectos, nullam sui mentionem habitam ita est questus z
⁶ Irasd me tibi wito, quod non in plerisque ejusmodi scriptis mecum potissimum
loquaris. An vereris ne apud posteros tibi infame sit, quod videaris familiaris nobis esse?
Expressitque elogium, cujus initium est, ‘ Cum tot sustiueas‚’ ’' διο. Porphyrion, upon Epp-
i. 2⁰, init.. has this note: ‘⁸ Ex his versibus et in principio sequentis libri apparet Horatius
hoc volumen quasi novissimum totius operis habuisse. Nam secundum epistolarum
coactus adjecit ;’' and at the beginning of this Epistle he says: ‘⁸ Apparet huuc librum, ut
supra diximus, hortatu Caesaris scriptum esse ι cujus rei etiam Suetonius auctor est-'⁹
This Scholiast's authority therefore was probably no other thau that which we possea· in
the above memoir, which as early at least as his day was attributed to Suetonius. But
there is no improbability in the story. A similar theory has been advanced in respect to
the sixt-h Ode of the first book, addreesed to Agrippa, which, like this Epistle, deprecatos
the task of attempting the praises of a great man. Assuming the truth of Suetonius'
statement, we must place the date of thia Epistle aster the publication of the first book.
It is generally supposed, with some probability, that the Secular Ode was in Horace’s
mind when he wrote v. 132, sq. If so, the Epistle was not written till after A.u.c. 737.
Beyond this there are no data at all ease for fixing the time of composition.

Horace begins by excusing himself for not having written before (supposing the truth
of the above story) by the great labours and anxietiea of Augustus, on whose attention it
was not for him to intrude. He goes on to commend the discriminatiou of the people,
who, contu-ary to that usual practice by which great men are loaded with envy and abuse
when alive aud with honours only aster they are dead, had recognized Augustus' divinity
already. But having given the age that credit, he reproaches their judgment in respect to
deceased and living authors, the former of whom they commended only, because they were
dead aud gone, while the latter they abused through envy aud spite· There is something
in this complaint which corresponds with his censure of Lucilius and his admirere written
many years before. But Lucilius does not appear in this poem, in which the dramatie
writers are those more particularly noticed. It appears that Augustus was very partial to
these himself, and Horace probably means indirectly to remonstrate with the emperor’s
tacte in this matter, and to put in a plea for himself and his bretbreu, though that this
