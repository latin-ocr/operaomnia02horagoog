688 HORATII FLACGI

Libris et curie, statua taciturnius exit

Plerumque et risu populum quatit3 hic ego renim

Fluctibus in mediis et tempestatibus urbis 85
Verba lyrae motura sonum connectere digner!

Frater erat Romae consulti rhetor, ut alter

Alterius sermone meros audiret honores,

Gracchus ut hic illi, forebhuic ut Mucius ille,

Qui minus argutos vexat furor iste poeta-s? 90

Carmina compon0‚ hic elegos.

“ Mirabile visu

caelatumque novem Musis opus !'' Adspice primum,
Quanto cum fastu, quanto molimine circum·-
Spectemus vacuam Romanis vatibus aedem Ξ

Mox etism, si sorte meae, sequere et procul audi, 95
Quid ferat et quare sibi nect-nt uterque coronam.
caedimur et totidem plagis consumimus hostem

87. Frater erat Romae] who these
brothers were Horace does not tell us, and
it does not matter. One n jurisconsultus
(see S. i. 1. 9, n.) and the other ιι tencher
of rhetoric. The lawyer said the rhetoricinn
wne a perfect Gracchus for eloquence, end
he returned the compliment by declsring
thet his brother was e. second Scaevola for
legul learning. And this sort of mutual

flnttery goes on Horace says among ρφω,
and he cannot keep poce with their passion

for prnise, Tiberius Gracchus end his

brother Ceius, were both in Cicero's opinion ν

great oratore. We need not therefore st·-
tempt to decide which Horace means us to
understand hem. Q. Mucius Scaevola the
augur, son-in-lnw of C. Lnelius, and nn
early instructor of Cicero (Lael. c. l), wne
learned in the lnw3 but his namesake
und younger contemporary, the Pontifex

· Maximus, was more celebrated still. Cicero

(de Oret. i. 39) cellsfflim “ homo omnium
et disciplina juris civilis eruditissimus et
ingenio prudentisque acutissimus, et ora-
tione mexime limatus etque subtilis, etque
ut ego soleo dicere juris peritorum eloquen-
tissimus eloquentium juris peritissimus.”
This neme therefore like that of Gracchus
for orator-y, stands for s consummate
‘uriae

J 88. merce audiret honorem] Compare
(Epp. i. 7. 84) ¹⁴ vineta crepet mers.”

89. soret laute nt Mucius ille-J There
does not sppenr to be any extant MS. with
this reading. Fen mentions two editions of
1516 end 1520, by Giovnnni Britannico
which have it. Lambinus hes it, md says
nothing of the other reading (⁸ foret hic ut

Mucius illi ⁹), “quem temen vel duo vel
nemo secutus est” (Bentley); “immo itt
extat in quadraginta editionibus Lambininnn
recentioribus” (Cunninghnm Anius-dv. p.
77). But 1 oennot discover that any edi-
tions have it between Lambinus end Bent-
ley. Since Bentley nem-ly ull editors have
⁴ huic ut Mucius ille! This is probably the
true reading: nt leuet the other is uncouth
and unusual ι but how ' should have got
into all the known MS ., and nearly every
edition, I do not undedtand.

90. armatos] Compare iv. 6. 25: ‘⁴ Doc-
tor argutae fidicen Theline? It means
melodicus, nnd is n sort of moek compliment.

92. &aetatemque novem Muris opu] It
is likened to s perffict piece of σαι-ναὶ work
in which ull the Muses hndehnnd. Bentley
has invented ⁴ oneratum!

93. quanto molimine] This expresses
the pomponium-ut with which they pnes the
librar-y of Apollo, in which they take it for

95. procul] This word significa my
distance, great or small. Here it means
hard by, ss in S. ii. 6. 105; ΕΡΡ. i. 7.
‘Quid feret’ means whsteachhnsto eny.

97. caedimur et totidem playn‘ae] They
carry on such e. contest of mutual Μῦες,
that they nrelike two gladiaturaench tryinq
to get the better of the other. ⁶ Samnites
