CARMINUM ΙΙ. 11.

Qum bellicosus Cantaber et Scythes,
Hirpine Quinti, cogitet Hadria
Divisus objecto remittas
Quaerere, nec trepides in usum

Poscentis aevi pauca.

Fugit retro 5

Levis juventas et decor, arida
Pellente lascivos amores
Canitie facilemque somnum.
Non semper idem floribus est honor

Vernis neque uno Luna rubens nitet

Voltu: quid aeternis minorem
Consiliis animum fatigas?
Gur non sub alta vel platano vel hac
Pinu jacentes sic temere et rosa

Canos odorati capiIIOS‚

Dum licet, Assyriaque nardo

2. Hirpine Quinta] ‘rho names are in-
verted, as in C. ii. 2. 3, 44 Crispe Sallusti.'’

3. rentium] For examples of ‘ remitto,'
in the sense of defen-ing (as C. iv. 4. 21,
4 quaerere distuli’), or altogether omitting,
see Forcell. Lambinus interprete the word
by ‘ remissius quaeras!

4. trepides] This word, the root or stem
of which is ‘trep' (rpirw),signifies to hurry
hither and thither. So 44 pars castra hos-
tium, pars terga trepidantium invaderet''
(Livy, xxvii. 1); that is, while they were
hurryiug about in confusion, before they had
time to form in line. Hence to be eager
or anxious, as here and elsewhere. Some
commentatore interpret the words 'as if
Horace meant to say “ne trepides aevi
(causa sc.) paucs poscentis in usum,” think·
ing that 4 trepidare in usum aevi' is not
tnnslstoeble. But 4 trepidare aevi' is not
latin, and not a Graecism that Horace
would adopt. ‘ In usum ' Graevius explains
‘in sumptum vitae,’ quoting Cic. ad Att.
(xi. ll)= “ Id quoque velim cum illa videas
ut sit qui utamur,’' i. e. 44 uude sumptus
sustineamus.” Also he quotes St. Paul to
the Philippisns iv. 16: καὶ ἅπαξ καὶ δὶς
εἰς τὴν χρείαν μοι ἐπέμψατε, which the
vulgate translates 44 semel et bis in usum
mihi misistis.''

9. honor]
‘ honos’ and ⁴ honor!
fei-able for euphony, and Bentley says he
who first changed it tn ‘ honos’ had no ears.
· Lambinus and Cruquius and some of the
old editions have ⁴ honos!

The MSS. vary between
'nae latter is pre-

10. rubens] So Propertius (i. 10. 8)=
‘⁴ Et mediis caelo Luna ruberet equis.''
This word is no where else used to express
the brilliancy of the moon. Catullus uses
it for the bright yellow of the ripe corn
(xx. 7): 44 Rubens arista sole fervido ;'’ and
claudian (in Rufin. i. 102) for the golden
waters of Pactolus = 44 stagna rubentis Aurea
Pactoli.'’ Aulus Gellius has a chapter on
colours (Noct. Att. ii. 26), in which Favo-
rinus the Sophist discusses that subject with
the orator Fronto, and attributes to the
poverty of the Latin language, as compared
with the Greek, its description of various
bright colom-s by one word ‘ rubor :' 44 quum
aliter rubeat ignis aliter sanguis aliter astrum
aliter coccum, has singulas rufi varietates
Latina oratio— significat una ruboris appel-
latione.” Virgil even applies it to the green

fields in spring (Georg. iv. 306): ‘⁴ Ante ³

novis rubeant quam prata coloribus.”

11. minorem] This, like ἥσσων, signifies
4 the victim οἷ’ or 4 a slave to,’ as we should
say.

1⁴. sic temere] 4 Sic' has a force of its
own,signisying 4 carelessly,' ‘as it may be‚' as,
among other places, Terence, Phorm. (i. 2.
94): 44 Quid paedagogus ille? quid rei
gerit? Gn. Sic tenuiter.” οὕτως has the
same force. St. John describes our Lord
sitting at Jacob’s well in these words: ὁ·-
cdv Ἰησοῦς κεκοπιακὼς ἐκ τῆς ὀδοιπορὶας
ἐκαθέζετο οὕτως ἐπὶ τῇ πηγῇ (iv. 6).

16. Assyriaque nardo] It was not only
the poets that confounded Syria and Assy-
ria. Cicero (in Verr- ii. 3. 33) speaks of
