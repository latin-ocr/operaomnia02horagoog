OARMEN IV.
A.U.c. 729.

This amusing ode represents a gentleman in love with his maid-servant3 a circum-
stance of sufficiently common occurrence to war-rant the supposition that Horace may
have had one of his friends in view, and that the ode is founded on fact. The name
Xanthias must be fictitious, and Phoceus indicates that the person was also supposed to
be a Phocian. It is usual to suppose that ⁴⁶ Xanthiae Phoceus'’ represents two names,
and ‘⁴ ad Xanthiam Phoceum’' is the common inscription, as if Phoceus were a Latin
name, which the second line provee it is not. Why Horace, assuming a Greek name for
his real or supposed friend, should also make him a Phocian, who can pretend to tell?
‘⁴ Say it was his humour,” or there may have been a significance in it which has passed
away, or never existed but for the under-standing of the person addressed and perhaps a
few intimate friends. Xanthias was a name given to slaves, like Geta, Sosius, &c., as in
the ‘⁴ Frogs ” and other plays of Aristophanes.

The ·date of the ode cannot be mistaken. Horace was born A. u.c. 689, and he wrote
this ode when he was just finishing his eighth lustre, which would be in December,
A.u.c. 729.
