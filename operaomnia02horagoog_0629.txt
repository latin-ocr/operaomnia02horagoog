Its rincipal town, Chios, was a noble city,
ric y adorned with buildings and works of
art. Verres plundered it of some of its
best statues (Cic. in Verr. ii. ξ. 19). Not
a tracs of any thing remains. Horace
calls Lesbos celebrated, and its same need
1101 00 supposed to depend on its wines, or
on Alcaeus and Sappho, as the commen-
tators say. From the Trojan War to the
times of the Roman Empire, when Tscitm
calls it “insula nobilis 01 amoena ” (Anu.
vi. 3), 1110 fortunes of Lesbos, its revolu-
tions and conquesta, its connexion with
Athens, its tradition of Orpheus, its poets
and musicians and statesmen, its cities and
works of art, its fields and vineyards and
climate, 011 contributed to make it the most
conspicuous island in the Aegean.

Samos (the island) is rough, but the
town is meant, and it is called ‘concinna'
from its buildings, of which a temple of
Juno was 0110 of the most conspicuous.
Cicero calls it “fanum antiquissimum 01
nobilissimum ’' (V err. ii. 1. 19 . Outside
and inside this temple was orned with
the {inest works of art. There was also a
celebrated 10010 at Samos, made to protect
the harbour, which would 110 an object of

The town of Sardes (al Σάρδεις), or the
greater part of it, from the readiness with
which it was burnt to the ground in the
revolt of the Ionians, 0.(1. 499, must ori-
ginally have been built of slight 0101011010,
though it was the 0001 of enormous wealth
during the reigns of the Lydian kings, and
especially 11101 of Croesus, whose palace be-
came the msidence of the Persian Sata-aps
and was beautifled by them, especially by
Cyrus the younger, whose gardens 010
celebrated (Cic. de Senect. c. 17). The
strength of its natural position was extra-
ordinary. Τ110 river Pactolus flowed through
the city. There are ruins still in existence,
one of which (of brick) is said to have been
the palace of Croesus. There are traces
of a theatre and marble piers supporting
1000000 of brick, but all these and the other
no doubt are Roman. Sardes surrendered

and his descendants, and the kings of Per·

He did not live to do so, but Antigonus
began and Lysimachus finished a new town
on a magnificent scale. Strabo (1. xiv. p.
646) gives a description of it, and of
it as 0110 of the most beautiful cities of
Ionia. There are coins of the empire
