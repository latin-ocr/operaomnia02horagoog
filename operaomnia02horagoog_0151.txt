Utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
Consentit astrum. Te J ovis impio

Tutela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit volucrisque Fati

Tardavit alas, cum populus frequens

25

Laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum:
Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat‚ nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset, Mercurialium

Custos virorum. Reddere victimas

30

Aedemque votivam memento :
Nos humilem feriemus agnam.

21. Utrumque nmirum] Persius (v. 46.
51) has repeated and expounded Horace's
ideas·writing to his master Annaeus Cor-
nutus:
‘⁴ Non equidem hoc dubites amborum foe-
dere certo
Consentire dies et sb uno sidere duci.
Nostra vel aequali nispendit tempora Librs
Parca tenax veri, seu nata fidelibus hora
Dividit in Geminos concordia fata duorum,
Saturnumque gravem nostro Jove aefi-an-
gimus una,
Nescio quod certe est quod me tibi tem-
perat ιιείῑιἾιιιι.υ

23. refulqem] Shining in opposition,
so as to counteract his influences. Thus it
is doubtful whether ⁴ Saturno’ be governed
by ‘ refulffens' or ⁴ eripuit! Bentley takes
⁴ volucris with ⁸ slas.’ for which ⁴ eeleres'
would hsve been a more suitsble end pro-
bable epithet‚ as in C. iii. 29. 53.

26. ter crepuit conume] So Propertiust
‘⁸ Natalis nostrae signum misere puellae

Et manibus faustos tercrepuere sonos.”

⁴ Puellae,' i. e. ⁶ Musae!

28. Sta-§tuleram Tne use of the indi-
cative in hypothetical cases of this kind
is not easily reduced to rulo ς but it
seems to correspond to the Greek construc-
tion of ἂν with the indicative. When the
condition is not fulfilled, or is a negative
condition, or implies a negation, then the
consequent clause may be expressed by the
indicative mood, in the pluperfect tense if
the action be a complete action end past, in
the perfect if it be present. “ Sustulerat si
non levasset: sed levavit.” See Wagner on
ileu. ii. 55. See also his note on Aen. iv.

“ Si miqqpt pertaesum thalami tsedeeque
9

Huic uni forsan potui succumbere culpaef'

where the perfect is used to express what
might have been done at the time of speak-
isnegg grffiwhilcgi igaefireeks used the imperiea-

“ Tristes excubiae munierant salis
gluilgdem pavidum J uppiter et Venus
Risissent.”

Professor Key (L. G. 1214, sqq.) says that
the apparent exceptions to the rule that in
such ceses as this the subjunctive is required
inbothclauses‚are to beexphined forthe
most part by the sentences being ellipticnl.
He also quotes this passage. and explains it
as a ‘⁴ mere instance of ordinary exaggera-
tion forthwith corrected.” He translates the
words thusz ‘⁴ Horace a hunk down gliding
on his scull had carried off (or at least would
have done so), had not Faunus with his
hand lightened the blow.'' It is very diffi-
cult to put into words the nicet? of a con-
ventional expression. Mr. Key s judgment
always commands respect, but this expla-
nationis hardly satishctory, 1 think; though
it is more easy to feel the force of the con·-
struction than to explain it. It is common
in our own language, in which Horace’s
mmmm& ,ξς 3:⁸3⁸ ruffi 12⁴3
ened the blow.” Mr. Key adds in a note,
“it should be observed‚ that in sentences of
this character the ⁸ nisi’ or ⁶ si’ always fol-
lows.” See Mr. Long’s note on Cic. in Verr-
ii. 5. ⁴9, ‘⁴ licitum esset, . . . veniebant.”
Horace was under the particular care of
Μοῖσαι-Υ, the Muses, and Faunus, to each
of whom, ss well as to Liber (iii. 8. 7), he
attributes his preservation on this memor-
able occasion (C. iii. 4. 27). Faunus or
Pau was the sou of Hermes or Meu-cury.
