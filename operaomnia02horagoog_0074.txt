date of this ode, in which 11010 invited 10 drink some Sabine wine bottled on that occa-
sion. Now wine of this sort was 1101111110 prime under four years’ keeping (C. i. 9, 7, 11.),
and was not likely 10 have been fit to drink under two years. After, therefore, the reader
has satisfied himself better than 1 can satisfy him of the date of C. ii. 13 and 17, 110 viu

ARGUMENT.

Yon shall have some poor Sabine, Maecenas, bottled at that time when the 0011οο0 of the
vatican resounded your praises. Yon drink Caecuban and Calenian, bnt the vines of
Falernum and Formiae are not for me.
