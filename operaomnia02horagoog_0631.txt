qunrtere, nnd this is no indication of the

· population. Suetonius (Tib. 4⁰) makes the

number upwnrds of 20,000.
These two towns ποιο proverbinlly joined
together, for besides this ploce we find in

Juvenal (S. x. 99),—
“ Hujus· qui uehitur prsetextsm sumere

virgil mentions them together aa colonies of
Alba (Aen. vi. 773) :—

⁸⁴ Hi tibi Nomentum, et Gabios, urbemque

where it may be observed Vin-gil shortens
the first syllable, when-ens Horace and
Juvennl and Silius (xv. 91) mnke it long.
8. tamen illic vivere veum] There is
sgood deal of difficultyin respecttothe
connexion end meaning of this passage end
the next. Horace seems to menn thst
though Lebedus vves n place desei-ted, he
could enjoy living there though it cut him
off from nli his friends for the sake of the
fine prospect it gave of the ses, which
would be nn exaggernted way of speaking.
He had probably in mind some occasion
when he hndndmired the sen from Lebedus,
sud the recollection enine upon him strongly
ns he wrote3 or Bullatius moy heve said
something in n letter nbout the fine pro-
spect, end Hor-nee means thet he agrees
with him. But. he goes on to say, there is
n time for ull things. The treveller, when
he gets splsshed, mny be glad of e tavern
to retire to and cleon himself, bnt he would
not wish to stay there all his life ς end the
msnwhohns gotchilledmnybe glndof n
fire or hot bath. bnt hc does not reckon
lires end hot bnths the chief good of lifez
and though you msy hsve been glsd to get

onshorein sforeignlnndto acopon-aun

tostaythere foi-ever. Isamnisin

The pnvement is now generally covered with

pretation given to the verse lest referred to.

snge is not given by Fon-cellini under ⁸ enl-
