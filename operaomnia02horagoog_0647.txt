37. corrector Bestiam] This reading is
due to Lambinus, who first conjecmred it,
and, before the publication of his second
edition, found it in one of his oldest MSS„
but did not take it into the text. Bentley
defends it, and was the first editor to adopt
it. Most modern editors have done the
same. ΤΙιο meaning, if this be the true
reading, is, that Maenius, whenever he
could not get a good dinner from one of
those who patronized or were afraid of him,
would dine prodigiously off tripe and coarse
mutton, and then declax-e all good livers
ought to be branded on the belly: a censor
as strict as Bestius, who was no doubt some
person well known at the time, perhaps as
a spare liver or reprover of profligate living,
though nothing is known of him now.

‘Correctorss which was used‘ ιιι a technical
sense during the empire for a person sent
into a province to put it in order, a special
commissioner‚ is here used (if it is the true
reading) for a reformer of mox-ala, as in
Epp. ii. l. 129 it is applied to poeta. The
old redings and those of most of the MSS.
are ‘'correctus and ‘lcorreptus Some
editions have the stop before Bestius and
others aster it. some also substitute Mae-
nius for Bestius, connecting it with ’ ἰιίιιιιῑι.ν
The amount of authority and support for
each of these readings may be learnt from
Obbarius or Fea. The MS. authority sor
’ corrector ’ is very small, but Ι believe
it is right. 1 can make no· sense of the
others.

39. Verterat iu fimum et cinerm,]

This was evidently an ordinary ny of
speaking. We need not refer the expra-
sion to the sacking of towns or the kitchen
lire, as an authority quoted by Orelli does.
He got rid ofall the plunder he made fmm
foola who patronized him.

41. Nil melius turdo, nil cuba]
‘turdus' see S. ii. 5. lo, n. The womb
and breast (’ sumen ’) of a sow, especially
aster herfirst litter, were consid eredgreat
delicacies.

42. Nimirum laic eqo eum .·] Compare
Epp. 6. 40. ‘ne fueris hic tu.” ἐνταυθ’
εἰμί is a common expression with the ‘1³:2⁹
gedians. ‘Nimiruml of course, aa is na-
tural: how could any thing better be ex·
pected of me? (See Epp. 9. 1.) He mans
to say that of course, like his neighbonrs, ⁸
he professes love for poverty while he is
poor, but directly he geta any money he is
ready for any extravaganoe.

46. nitidis ficudata pecunia εὕδω]
‘Villa ’ was a country house. as opposed to
‘ssaedes a town house. There were ‘villae

rusticae,' farm housee, and‘ villae urbanae?
houses in the neighbourhood of towns (to
which sense we limit the word in our nse
of it) or in the country, bnt built· ιιι many
respects aster the fashion of town houna
A good description of both is given in
Becker’s Gallus. The ’ urbanae villae’
were often built at great expense, with
much marble about them, which is referred
to in ‘nitidisss ‘Fffimdata' meana ‘inv-ested!
