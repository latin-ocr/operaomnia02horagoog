he was about twenty. Whether his father was alive at that time or

dead is uncertain. If he went to Athens at twenty, it was in ΛΑΜ).

709, the year before Julius Caesar was assassinated. After that event .
Brutus and Cassius left Rome and went to Greece. Foreseeing the ’
struggle that was before them, they got round them many of the young

men at that time studying at Athens, and Horace was appointed tri-

bune ⁷ in Brutus' army, a high command for which he was not qualified.

He went with Brutus into Asia Minor, and finally shared his defeat at

Philippi, Aue. 712. Η9 makes humorous allusion to this defeat in his ³
Ode to Pompeius Varus (ii. 7). After the battle he came to Italy, 4
having obtained permission to do so, like many others who were willing
to give up a desperate cause and settle quietly at home. His patri.
mony ⁸, however, was forfeited, and 119 seems to have had no means of
subsistence, which induced him to employ himself in writing verses, with
the view perhaps of bringing himself into notice ⁹ rather than for the
purpose of making money by their sale. It is not impossible, however,
that some of his earliest compositions were severe personal satires and
lampoons, written at the instigation of those who were able to pay
him for them. That the book of Epodes which we possess does not
contain all that he wrote in Archilochus’ vein, I think is pretty cer-
tain; and the same I believe may be said of the books of Satires. Pro-
bably his earliest efforts were more severe and licentious than those
which his judgment allowed him afterwards to publish, though some
of these are bad enough. With Archilochus and Lucilius before him

 

as models, and without the experience he afterwards gained, bis earliest
productions may without difficulty be supposed to have been such
as in later life he would condemn. By some means he managed to
get a place as scriba ¹ in the Quaestor’s office, whether by purchase
or interest does not appear. In either case we must suppose he con·
trived soon to make friends, though he could not do so by the course
he pursued without also making many enemies. His Satires are full of
allusions to the enmity his verses had raised up for him on all hands.
He became acquainted, among other literary persons, with virgil and
Varius, who about three years after his return (nme. 715) introduced
him to Maecenas. who was careful of receiving into his circle Brutus’
tribune, and one whose writings were of a kind that was new and un*-
popular. He accordingly saw nothing of Horace for nine months after
his introduction to him. He then sent for him (mue. 716), and from

⁹ Kirchner (Qu. Hor. p. 15, 11. 4) and Franks (Fast. Hor. p. 20) reject this notion,
supposing Horace to mean in the passage on which it is founded (Epp. ii. 2. 51) that
poverty made him desperate and careless of consequences‚ but that when he becuns com-

pmtively rich he lost that stimulus. ¹ Suet. vit. S. ii. 6. 36.
