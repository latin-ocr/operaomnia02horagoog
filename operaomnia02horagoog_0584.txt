EPISTOLARUM 1.' 2. 559

good teste end sense, ester e continuom perunl of Homer, should be that whieh is here
given is not easily eooounted for. Horace hsd his head fun of his new study of philo-
sophy, end saw more of practiml wisdom in these poems than in the writings of the
philosophare end sophists. In v. 4 he seems to imply that Chrysippus und Crantor, end
such like philosophers, who thought they got wisdom stom Homer by reflning upon him,
did not know what they were about. Their tesoher was plain and intelligible: the
fountoin was deur, but they made the stream muddy, end the best thing α young mun
could do was to rond Homer straight through sud judge for himself. This is the best
interpretation 1 een put upon Hornoe's observatione, which at the beet ere not of much
velue, as bearing on the merite of Homer.

ARGUMENT.

While you ere deelsiming st Rome, Lollius, 1 sm reeding Homer ut Praeneste, α teeeher
above Chrysippus end Crantor themselves. Por consider, in thet Iliad of his how he
sets before us the pessions of princes end people= Antenoi-’s suge oounseh the selflsh
obstin-ey of Peris3 Nestor mediuting between ungry kings, one inflemed with love
und both with unger. The princes err, the people suffer. There is one soene of tree-
sons, stratagema, crime, lust, passion, in the Greeinn eemp or within the wells of Troy.
Then again he has given us s bright example of wisdom in Ulysses, driven over the
earth and seo, gethering experienoe ss he went, surrounded with the weves of suffering
but rising above them ull, end shunning the charnis of the Siren end the sweet poisons
of Ciree. why, we ore bnt eyphers, born but to eet end drink, like the suitors of
Penelope or the people of Alcinous, who slept end dnnoed und drove away esre with
the sound of the wenton lute.

Does the robber riso st midnight to kin, and do you not wake up to guard yourself
from evil? Nsy then, if you will not prsctise running while γοα ure well, you shall do
so with the dropsy in your skin: if you rise not eerly, end give your mind to study end
to virtue, γοα shall lie uwuke under the turtures of envy or lust. Why are you in such
haste to remove s grain of dust from your eye, but defer the euring of your mind’s dis-
eese? Begin und γοα have half done3 be bold to be πίθος begin. He who puts off
the day of reformationi is like the clown thet weits tiu the stream runs dry.

But men nre for money snd esse, und for leying field to field. Let him that hes enough
not wish for more. Riches will not take sever from the vein· or grief from the heert.
Its owner should be sound in body end mind ir he would enioy what he hes Βοῦς but
he who is always anxious gete no more good from his riehes then the blind from a pie-
ture, the gouty from s fomentation, or the deut· from the sounds of a lyre3 for if the
vessel is foul whatever you pour into it turns sour- Heed not pleesure3 it is den-ly
bought with pain. The oovetous never hes enough, therefore set bounds to your
desires. ·

Envy ever pines over others’ success, s greater torment than ever tyrsnt invented.
Weslth too, if it be not under control, will urge you to do thet γοα will wish undone ε
it is α brief mndneesz it must be either servunt or mester z put s bit or s chain upon
it. The horse is truined to his rider's will3 the hound is taught to hunt3 even so
drink in instruction, my young friend, and give yourself up to the wise- The oesk keeps
its odour long. Think not however thet 1 een weit for you ir γοα lag behind, or keep
up with you if you ere too vigorous end push on before.
