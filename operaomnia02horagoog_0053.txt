28 HORATII FLAOGI

GARMEN IX.

This is a drinking-song for the winter imitated from an ode of Alcaeus, of which the
following fragment has been preserved in Athenaeus (34 Bergk) :
ὕει’μὲν ὁ Ζεὺς, ἐκ δ’ ὀρανῶ μέγας
χείμων, πεπάγασιν δ’ ὑδάτων ῥόαι
1 ἶ 1 „2

κάββαλλε τὸν χεῖμων’ ἐπὶ μὲν τιθεῖς
πῦρ, ἐν δὲ κίρναις οἶνον ἀφειδέως
μίλιχρον, αὐτὰρ ἀμφὶ κόρσᾳ
μάλθακον ‹impu-1911 γνόφαλλον.

Th0ugh the obvious fact that this ode is a close imitation of a Greek writer, might well
lead us to believe that it is s. mere work of art, some of the chronologists have found it a
dote esch according to his own views. Dillenburger thinks it was written soon after the
battle of Philippi, when Horece's friends were apt to dwell on unpleesant topice end re-
quired to have their spirits kept up⁴ J eni supposes it was written et the country-house
of one Thaliarchus, not far ftom Mount Soracte. Buttmann too thinks this is s proper
name, (though of course fictitious,) in which 1 see no resson to agree with him. ¹

ARGU MENT.

See Soracte stands out with snow, the woods are bending with their burthen, and the
sharp ftost bath frozen the streams. Heup logs on the {ire end drew your best
Sabine wine, feast-muter, and leave the rest to the gods, st whose bidding the fierce
winds are still and the woods have rest. Ask not what is to come3 enjoy the present
day: let the dsnoe be ours while we are young, the Campus Martius, the promensde,
the nightly assignation, and the eoy girl that loves to be caught.

1. siet] This signifiesufixedand prominent
appearance which perhaps is best expressed
by the words 1 have used in the Argument.

(Virg. Ecl. vii. 53), ‘⁴ Jam pulvere melum
sture vident” (Aen-xii. 407), have something
of the same meaning. Soracte was one of
the Faliscan range of hills about 2200 feet
high and 24 miles from Rome. It is now
called Monte Tresto, a corruption from ‘ San
Oreste! There is ι village of that name
at the sar.. end of the range (Westphsl, Die

Riimische Kampagne ). It is seen very
clearly from the northern point of the city.
Apollo hed s temple there: ‘⁴ Summe deum
sancti custos Soractis Apollo,” Aen. xi. 785.

4. constiterint] See Ov. Tr. v. 1⁰. l:
“Ut sumus in Ponto ter frigore constitit
Ister.” ‘Acuto,’ as applied to cold, cor-
responds to the ὀξεῖα χιών of Pindur, and
⁴ penetrabile frigus' of Virgil. But Horace
also applies it to heat (Epp. i. 10. 1¹7) ε “ Cum
semel accepit solem ftuibundus acutumss’

7. Deprome quadrimum Sabina,—diota.]
