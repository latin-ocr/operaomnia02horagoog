Pnoscmrn Regis Rupili pus atque venenum

Hybrida quo pact-o sit Persius ultus, opinor

Omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus esse.

Persius hic permagna negotia dives habebat

ClazomeniS, etiam lites cum Rege molestas, 5
Durus homo atque odio qui posset vincere Regem,

Confidens tumidusque, adeo sermonis amari

Sisennas Barros ut equis praecurreret albis.

Ad Regem redeo.

l. Proscripti Reyis Rupili] 'rho Ru-
pilia gens was a plebeian family of no great
note in Rome. The only one of the name
who was distinguished was P. Rupilius,
consul in Amr-c. 622, and the following year
{4¹23ss ὢιῗζῗῖηα Ηῶ.ᾞ..ᾛὲἑ““εὲ,ῗῖἒ
(Cic. de Amicit. 27). As 10 ‘Rupilius Rex
and Persius, see Introduction.

2. Hybrida quo pacto eit Penius ultum]
Aaou says ‘hybrida ' is properly the off-
spring of an eagle and vulture3 Porphyrion,
of a low-bred dog and a bound ς Pliny (N. H.
viii. 53. 79) and Martinl (viii. 22), of a tame
sow and a wild boar. The word applies to
all crosa-bred animals, and was used for
a man one of whose parents was a Roman
and the other a foreigner.

3. Omnibus et lippis notum et tumoribus]
The apothecaries' and barbers’ shops were
constantly crowded with idion, who had
nothing to do but to· gossip about the news
of the hour. With the barber-s it has been
so in all ages and countries. The Romans
were commonly afflicted with weakness of
the eyes, and this caused the apothecary to
be as much mixed up with idlers as the
barber. In Plaums’ play, Amphitruo says
(iv. 1) he has been looking for Nauoeates
in all the most stoquented places :—

⁴⁸ Omnes platersss pei-reptavi, gymnasia et
m o =
Apud {mgnum atque 111 macell03 in
palaestra etque in for03
In medicinis, in tonstrinis, apud omnes
aedes sacres,
Sum defessus quaeritando.”

The expression in the text is a proverbial
way of speaking, and might have been used
any where. It does not prove that the
satire was written at Rome, as some say.

See also above, C. i. 12. 37, where Scauros
is probably put for the best of that family,
M. Aemelius. ⁴ Equis albis ' is equivalent
to ⁸ fleet steeds,' according to that line of
virgil (quoted by all the Scholiasta), in
which he describes the horses of Tui-nus
“ Qui candore nives anteirent, cursibus
auras ” (Aen. 311. 84). Plautus speaks of
white horso· 111 a proverbial wey for swift·
neas (Asin. 11. 2. 12) 2—-

“ Nam si sehuic occasioni tempus subter-
ΝιωιΞιΞΞὲξξεροί quadrigis albis indipiscet

And as the horses of Jove were said to be
white, this proverb connects itself with an-

other in the Amphitruo (i. l. 297) :—

⁴⁶ Mer. Quo agis te? Soc. Domum. Mer.
Quadi-igis si nunc inscendas J ovis
Atque hinc fugias, ita vix poteris ecfugere
infortunium.”

The Scholiasts also refer the proverb in the
text to the circumstance, that white horses
were used in triumphal processione.
