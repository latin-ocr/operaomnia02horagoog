CARMEN I.
A.U.C. 730.

ermxn this ode is en introduction to one book or three ie e question thet hu
been disc-:seed and must be matter of opinion. 1 think it probable that the three
first books were published together, with this es a prefece3 and if the chronological
arrangement 1 have adopted (see Inuoduction) be correct it was written A.u.c. 7303
but there is no internnl evidence to lead to thet conclusion. Bentley was of opinion
that each book was produced separately. It is a graoeful dedication to Maecenas of a
work, the composition of which had occupied end nmused the poet et interula for some

- years. It wne probably at his petron’s insfigztion that h‘e mnged his fugitive piecee

and put them forth in this collected form. There ie a mixture of red affection with
the usual dedicatory flattery in this ode, the leading ideo of which, as in most cnseo,
Horace probably borrowed from the Greek. There ie a fragment of Pindu- (2⁰1 Bergk),
preserved in Sextus Empiricus, which with othere Horace moy hove hed in mind, end
it viu account for the eomewhet incongruens allusion to the Olympio gemes in the
beginning of this ode. It is the only wey of explaining the allusion to en almost obso-
lete practice, to beer in mind that thia was the chief theme of Pindar'e poetry. The
fragment runs thus :—

ἇελλοπόδων μὲν τιν’ εὐφραίνουσιν ’ἱππ-ων

τίμια καὶ στέφανοι· τοὺς δ’ ἐν πολυχρύσοις θαλάμοις βιοτά·
τέρπεται δὲ καί τις ἐπ’ οἶδμ’ ἅλιον ναῒ 9οᾷ

σῶς διαστείβων .....

Δ stegment of Archilochus (33 Bergk), from Clemens Alexandrinus, runs:
ἀλλ’ ἄλλος ἄλλῳ καρδίην ἰαίνεται.
But the sentiment ie common enough, and with the exception of the first illusa-etion
Horace hae put the subject in his own way and given it a Latin dress. It will be
obem-ved, that while the leading sentiment ie the common-place ⁴⁴ different men have dif-
fer-t testea,” Horace selecto only the pursuits of worldly or mechanical minda to con-
trast (not without some contempt) with his own higher ambition. He hed, no doubt, in
his memory ergll's lines (Georg. ii. 503, eqq.): ⁴⁴ sollicitant elii remis frete ceece,'’ διο.
