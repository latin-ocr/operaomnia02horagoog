‘Iuoeepuit lyra’ therefore signifies, ‘checked

and adopted this explg'snafion, should have
changed his mind and followed the Scho-
liasta und those after them who join ‘'lyrs
with‘ loqui¹ is very surprising. His judg-
ment generally directed him better than
thia. In ι matter of teste second thoughts
