21. Beatus Fannius] This is a doubtful
passage. This Fannius is spoken of in
another place (S. i. lo. 80) as a contemptihle
person and a parasite of Hermogenes Tigel-
lius (S. 8. 129, n.). What the Scholiasta
say of him is this: that he had the cogno·
men Quadratus: that he was a poet full of
words and folly; that the Senate made him
a present of some ⁸ capsae ' (book-boxes)
and a bust of himself, that when he was
dying he desired his books and book-cases
to be burnt publicly3 otherwise, that he
was a writer of Satire, and childless, and
that certain persons, hoping ιο be remem-
bered in his will, got his busts and his
books deposited in the public libraries, to
which honour his own merits did not entitle
them. Wherever all this came from, it is of
no value at all for determining Horace’s
meaning in this passage. Lambinus follows
the Scholiasta so far as ιο suppose that
Fannius was honoured by a spontaneous
present (⁴ultroz’ see C. iv. 4. 51, n.) on
the part of the “ populus sive senatus ”
of a set of book-boxes and a bust, as a
mark of public respect. And Turnebus
says, ‘⁴ Fannium nescio quem poetam cujus
libros Romani st armario et capsa, ipsum
imagine donarant, prae se felicem praedicat.”
But who ever heard of such a thing? and
who was this Fannius that he should have
been thus distinguished? It appears pro·
bable, from Horace’s words, that Fannius
had his admirere, as rant and emptiness
will always have, and that they made him a
ffi‘aflyffl's fflafflnffffiffl 233:
bust. The ‘ capsa ' was a round box suited
to hold one or more rollsd volumes. The
lai-ger sort was called ‘scriniuml (See
Smith's Dict. Ant.) Neither ‘ capsae ' nor
⁴ scrinia' are ιο be confounded with ‘ar-
maria,' which were cupboards, not boxes,
but also used for books, though not con-
fined to that purpose any more than
‘ capsae’ were. What the Scholiasta say
about Fannius' bust having been placed iu

sistent with usage. Asinius Pollio built a
library mmo. 715, or thereabouts, and
placed in it porti-aits and busts of various
distinguished men, and the practice was
thenceforward obser-ved not only in the
public librarios, but in those of private
persons. Martial, writing ιο his friend
Avitus, sends him an inscription for his own
hust, which Avitus was going to put with
others in his library:

“ Hoc tihi sub nostra breve carmen imagine
Qullmat'non obscuris jungis, Avito,
viris.” (ix. l.)

23. volgo recitare timentis] See note
on v. 73. The usage which leaves the per·
sonal pronoun to be infer-red from the pos-
sessive is common both in Greek and
Latin. (See C. iii. 22. 6.) Compare
Arist. Plut. 33 ι

τὸν ἐμὸν μὲν αὑτοῦ τοῦ ταλαιπώρου σχεδὸν ·
ἤδη νομίζων ἐκτετοξεῦσθαι βίον,

and Ovid (Heroid. y. 45 : “Et flesti, et
nostros vidisti flentis oce os.” ‘ Timeo ’
and ⁴ metuo ’ do not govern an infinitive
mood iu the prose writings of Horace's
day. ⁴ Vereor ' is used iu that construction.
Torrentius asks why Horace’s works should
not be read because he was afraid ιο recito
them in public? Was it because the multi·
tude follow opular applause which is drawn
forth by public display? The reason Ho-
race gives is the same that deters him from
reciting his poems, that no one likes ιο see
any more than ιο hear his own vices ex·
posed. People are not at all fond of ⁴ genus
hoc,' this satirical sort of writing, because
most are open ιο blame. He has particular
classes, or persons perhaps, in his eye‚when
he says ⁸ sunt quos ’ (C. i. 1. 3. n.); but he
speaks otherwise generally. That Horace
wrote many pisces which have not been
preserved, appears to me clear from this
passage and v. 71, sqq. See Introduction.
