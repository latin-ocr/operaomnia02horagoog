SATIRARUM Ι. 5.

Quae super est Caudi cauponas.

Nunc mihi paucis

Sarmenti scurrae pugnam Messique Oicirrhi,

near Montesarchio, in its neighbourhood,
various inscriptions have been found, in
which the names of persons belonging to
the family of Cocceius occur. At Caudium,
Cocceius had a handsome house, and Horace
marks its situation by saying it lay beyond
the public tavern. For ‘ Caudi ’ all Cru-
quius' MSS. (and he had some of the best)
read ‘Claudi,' and his Scholisst has this
“ quae est supra Claudii &quadam
cauponas. Claudii cauponae sive tabernae
oppidum est Samnii non procul a Bene-
vento.” But· Caudi' is, 1 have no doubt,
the right reading. The town was twenty-
one miles from Capua.

51. Nunc milti paucis] The scene that
follows represents a scurrilous contest be
tweeu two parasites Maecenas carried with
him for the entertainment of himself and
his . The description begins with an
invocation of the Muse, after the fashion of
the epic poeta, —an amusing parody, with
which Acron says some persons of his day
found fault; and stom Orelli 1 find there
ue some wzho have done so in οιιι· own.
‘⁸ Nimis profecto fastidiose,” he says ι
“ stulte,'' says the Scholiast, and most
persons will agree with him. Of ‘Sar-
mentus ' we happen to know a little more
thau is here recorded, from the Scholisst
on Juvenal, S. v. 3. ·

“Si potes illa pali, quae nec Sarmentus
cairan-¹²:²⁸³& mensas, nec vilis Galba ιιι-

(which Sarmentus, however, was a different

ιι from Maecenss’ parasite, though the
Scholiast confounds the two, see Plut. vit.
Auton- c. ⁶9). He says that Sarmentus
was sn Etrurian by birth, aud originally a
slave of M. Favonius (well known in the
civil wars, and put to death by Augustus
aiter the battle of Philippi). On the con-
fiscation of Favonius' pro Sarmentus

note ι

passed by public sale iambe hands of ·

M,aecenss who gave him his liberty. He
then got made a scriba in the ‘quaestor's
department, and affected the position of an
eques: and as he sat in the frent row in
the tm this Epigrsm was composed
upon

“Aliud scriptum habet Sarmentus· ς aliud
populus voluerat ι

Digna dignis. Sic Sarmentus habeat
crassas compedes.

Rusfflclgepe nihil agatis aliquis Sarmentum
(The joke' ιιι the first line is, ,that whereas

he had got himself one kind of ⁶ sciptum:
i. e. the office of a scriba, the ple wished
he had got another, i. e. the randing of a
runaway slave.) He was brought to trial
for pretending to a rank he hadug ιιο claim to
(perhaps under the law of Otho), and got
off only by the tavour of the judgee, aud by
the accuser being put out of the way.
When old he was reduced to great poverty
through his licentiousness and extrava-
gance, and was obliged ιο sell his place as
scribe. When persons taunted him with
this he shewed his ready wit by replying
thathehadagoodmemory, byw hich,
according to Rutgersius (Vsu. Iacet-e ‚xvi.
fin„ where this man's story is told), he
meant that he had no occasion to write any
thing down, for he could carry it· ιιι his head.
Ῑι appears that at the time Horace wrote
he was free, and held his scribe's office,
though he continued to amend Maecenas,
for his adversary says, though he was a
scribe, he was in fact only a runsway, and
still belonged to his mistress the widow of
Favonius (v. 66), which is only a joke that
would amuse Maecenas, who had bought and
manumitted Sarmentus. On the strength
perhaps of what is stated by the above
Scholiast, Porphyrion says Sarmentus was
a Roman eques, sud the same he says of
Messius. but doubtless with as little founda-
tion. When Horace says that Messius was
of the noble blood of the Osci (“ Messi
genus Osci sunt,” Porp h. -- ‘'Osci being
the nominative plural), he probably means
(as Estre says) what Cicero means by
{22:331 ἔῗῗίῗιῗιῗΐ „iiiam 3¹¹3ss ξέζῖ
on his temple which indicated the discsse
called Campanian (the Cam isus were of
Oscau desecat), of which uius' Scho-
liast writes thus: ‘⁸ Hoc enim quasi a
natura Campanis fere omnibus inest, ut
mpitis temporibus magnae verrucae innas-
cantur in modum cornuum= quas cum in-
cidi faciunt, cicatrices in fronte manent
quasi notae exsectorum cornuum. In hunc
ergo morbum, id est, faciei vitium, quo
Campani laborant, jocatur Ssrmeutus.” 0
This sort of disease is called by Aristotle
oarvpioeubgde GepheAniigi. ivof {032³ ΑἸἐὲιιιι
Oscans were au ors

lause fabulae‚' which were fun of broad
raillery and coarse wit, which may have
something to do with Horace’ s joke. ⁴ Ci-
cirrhus' is a nickname from κίκιρῤος, which
signifies, according to Hesychiusst a cock!
With these ex plsuations most of the allu-

aiens will be intelligible.
