2. Abdico ten-ind Lambinus’ conjecture
‘abditaeterris' ιο agree with ‘lamnae’ has
been adopted by many editors, but it has
no MS. authority. 1 see no other great
objection to it. ⁴ Avaris ' Doering under-
stands ιο be the dative case, ‘ hidden by the
avaridous in the earth ς’ as S. i. l. 41 τ

“ Quid juvat immensum te argenti pondus
Futlziitnudlefossa timidum deponere terra .²”

But, besides the confusion this introduces in
the construction, the force of the allusion is
thus lost. Sallustius possessed some valu-
able mines in the Alps, and to this circum-
stance Horace seems tacitly to refer. The
charum given of Sallustius by Tacitus
(Anu. iii. 3⁰) is rather different from
Horace’s description. Tadtus says he was
‘⁸ diversus a veterum instituto per cultum
et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu
propior :'' on the stmugth of which some
commentators have supposed Horace meant
to give him a hint upon his extravagance,
for which impertinence the great man
would not have thanlted him. To bear
out their csse they refer ‘ nisi temperato ’
ιο the first line. Horace inverts the order
of the cognomen and gentiliciam name, as
Tacitus frequently does ς as ⁴ Agrippam
Postumum ’ (Anu. i. 3), and elsewhere.
The eleventh ode of this book is addressed
to Quintius Hirpinusg and the names are
inverted as here.
lamna] Ovid (Fast. i. 207)=

‘⁸‘ J ura dabat populis posito modo consul
Belgi? argenti lamina crimen erat.”

For examples of syncope see i. 36. 8, n.

6. Vivet extento Proculeius aevo] Pro-
culeius is stated by the Scholiasta to have
assisted his brothers Caepio aud Murena,
who had lost their property in the civil
wars. Scipio, as the name ap in Ascen-
sius’ text of the Scholiasts, is a mistalte for
Caepio. But it is doubtful whether Caepio,
whose family name was Fannius, was any
relation of Proculeius Murena whose con·
spiracy he joined (see Introduction), or
whether Murena was Proculeius’ brother or
cousin. Proculeius was in great favour
with Augustus and was intimate with
Maecenas (who married his sister or cousin
Terentia), and probably with Sallustius.
He was alive at this time, and did not die
till aflaer Horace3 therefore the reading
⁴ agit ' which is that of many old MSS. is
rejected by most editors. Proculeius was
like Maecenas a favourer of letters, aud is
so referred to by Juvenal (S. vii. 94) ε
“ Quis tibi Maecenas quis nunc erit aut
Proculeius ?”

6. Notae-animi] Horace's adaptation
of Greek constructione is one of the chief
features of his style. He uses ⁴ metuente '
here in the same sense as in C. iv. 5. 20.
‘⁴ culpari metunt Fides,‘' ⁴ wings that refuso
to melt‚' as Icarus’ did.

9. Latius requos] This is referred to by ,

some (see note on v. 2) as showing that
Horace is addressing a lecture to Sallustius.
But he is only speaking genenlly (see
Argument).

ll. uterque Poenus] This means (as the
Scholiasts explain) the Carthaginians ofAffica
and their colonies in Spain, not the Phoeni-
cians as Graevius says. ⁴ Uterque pontus '
has been suggested by Schroedoe, because
there were not two Poeni. But the above
explanation is sufficient.
