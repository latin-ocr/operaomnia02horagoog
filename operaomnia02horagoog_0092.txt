what, Iccius, efter all dost thou grudge the Arabs their wenlth, end prepare chains for

the princes of sobm and the fieres Mede?

Which of the fuir barbariam dost

1. me] This word expresses surprise,
‘what now! to belie ull expectatione and
sbsudon all your pursuits !'

³. Sabaeae] The Romans had possession
of puteos Arabis. Petraea but not os Arabia
Felix. Hence he saje—

“ Intactis opulentior
Theanus-is Arabum.”

(C. iii. 24. 1.) It may have been reported
unt the army would prooeed against the
Parthians after the Arabs were conquered,
or ss is more probable the ⁴ horrible Mede '
is only introduced to heighten the colom-ing
os the picture.

ὁ. Οωε-οὲνρὶΜ-ὸανῠανο] Aves-‚vun-

ss 11· Iccius had only to choose for himself
some roysl damsel whose betrothed he was
ω shy with his own haud, und sn Essiam
page of great heeuty brought from his
native wilds to wait upon one of the princes
of this happy laud. If Horace oonsounds
Tutus and Parthians, it only makes the
picture nore absurd.

7. Puer es· aula] These words are to be
taken together. Boys whose office itwasto
pour out the wine m mlled in inscriptions
⁴ pueri a cyetho' or ‘sd cyathum,' or ‘ab
argento poton-iol ‘ad argeutum potorium?

‘e potione,' and so forth. Fen speaks of a
very elegant picture of a boy in the act of
ppuringoe wine, which was δας up at Rome in

13. nobilio Panaeti] lt is difficult to
decide whether Horace meant this epithet
for ⁶ libros ’ or ⁴ Panaeti! lt will suit either,
sinos the accusative plural is written in the
MSS. ⁴ es,’ ⁴ eis ’ or ⁴ is! Bentley connects
it with the stuic: but whether he is right

lomus =” ‘ coemptos ' is not an epithet, and
there was uo resson why Horace should not
say ⁴ nobiles libros coemptos ⁸ in the sense
‘quoscqetnisti’ if he hsdpleesed. Orelli
