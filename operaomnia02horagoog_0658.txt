derived, ss in other esses, rather from the
disciple than the founder of the school,
whose contempt for sensusl plessures, snd
stem opposition to the sels-indulgent spirit
of his nge, and especially cf the Cyrenaic
school (whatever desecte of judgment he
msy heve shown), plsce him very high in
the history of Greek philosophy. The
Cynico received their name from the place
where Antisthenes taught, the Cynosarges,

19. Scan-or 09⁰ lpse πιιἹιί,] This verb
does not occur elsewhere. The participle
is used in-the next Epistle (v. 2). Aristip-
pus is supposedtc parry the blcw (⁴ eludere

Diogenes thus, by admitting, for the sake

king ·yet it was for his own advantage·
whereas the Cynic acted parasite tc the pc-
pulsce for their amusementg he begged
their dirty provisions, and gave them snarl-
ing jests in return3 snd by sccepting their
slms he scknowledged himself their inferior,
and this though he professed to went nothing
of them or any one else. Diogenes is ssid
by his biographer snd namesake to have
beenredncedtobegging bypoverty. Itis
more prcbsble he wss s beggsr οιι principle,

Greek proverb· ἵππος με φὶρει, βασιλευς
με νρέφει. It occurs in the Παροιμίαι of
Diogenisnus, s grammarian in the time of
Hadrian, who compiled s lexicon, of which
ιι collection of proverbs formed part. He
says the words were first uttered by s sol-
dier of Philip of Mscedon to his mother,
who enti-ested him to ask exemption from
service. ‘Offim‘um' is commonly applied

rerum,' see C. iv. 12. 19, ιι. 8. ii. 8. 83.
Lambinus first introduced this reading from
some of his MSS.. which heve been con-
firmed by many since. The Scholiasta
