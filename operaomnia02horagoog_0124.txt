CARMEN VII.
A.U.c. 724.

‘⁴ Ad Pompilium Varum scribit gaudens ob ejus in patriam reditum quem commilitonem
in essm's Bruti et caesii fuisse commemorem et belli dvilis evasisse pericula Augusto
victore.” These ure the words of Acron, sod many of the MSS. have ⁴ Α» Pourimuu '
or ‘ Pouemuu Vnum) the latter being correct. But standon, followed by nearly all
commentatum till the last few years, has eonfounded the person here sddressed with
Pompeius Grosphus, to whom the loth ode of this book is written (see Introduction),
and who is mentioned in the twelfth epistle of the first book (v. 22). But the proscribed
follower of Brutus cannot be identified with the weelthy Grosphus, ss Essa-6 has observed,
ἰαὶ, ss Vnnderburg has remarked, the newly mede citizen would not heve been eddressed
in the lnngusge bere usedz ‘⁸ Quis te redonavit Quiritem Dis patrii· Italoque ‹aeloss'
Messon (Vie d'Horeee, p. 88, sq.) fixes the date in ,xm-c. 715, in which year those of the
republican party who had followed Sextus Pompeius were allowed to return, pesce being
mede between Sextus and the triumvirs, end sn amnesty being granted to his followers.
Kirchner (Q. H. p. 5) strongly supports this opinion. Dncier esks why then Home
should have used the words ‘⁴ Quis te redonavit, &e- ?” ond though the words must not
be taken too literelly ns a question, and are more nn expression of joyful surprise. yet
there is something in the remark; and moreover it is pretty certain thet Horace when he
wrote was in possession of his country-house, snd hed been in it some time (vv. 19, 20).
But he did not get this house till ester the first book of Satires wss finished, that is not till
A.u.e. 720, snd it may have been ι year or two later. The long ses-viee of Pompeius (men-
tioned in v. 18) is inconsistent with the above early date; sud something may be said in re-
spect to the style of the ode, which is one of Horace’s best. Also it is doubtful, nsit appears
to me, whether even in jest Horace would have alluded to Philippi in the way he here
does, if he were writing soon efter that memoroble disaster. On the whole it is most
proboble thet Pompeius did not return to Rome, ns Aaron infimstes, till aster the civil
war was over, having meanwhile followed the foi-tunes first of his namesake Sextus, ond
then of M. Antonius, and that the ode was written A.t5.c. 724, or thereabouts. ⁹

ARGUMENT.

Ο Pompeius, my earliest friend sud best, with whom I heve sei-ved and indulged full many
n day, who heth sent thee beck to us s true citizen of Rome? We fought snd ssed
together at Philippu but, while 1 was eerried off by Mercury‚ the wave drew thee beck
into the stormy ocean again. Come then puy thy vows unto Jove, and lay thy wenry
