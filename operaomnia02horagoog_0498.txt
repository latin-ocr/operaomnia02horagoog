SATIRARUM II. 3. 473

Blattarum ac 'tinearum epulae, putrescat in arca:
Nimirum insanus paucis videatur, eo quod
·Maxima pars hominum morbo jactatur eodem.
Filius aut etiam haec libertus ut ebibat heresi,

Dis inimice senex, custodis? Ne tibi desit?
Quantulum enim summae curtabit quisque dierum,
Ungere si caules oleo meliore caputque

Coeperis impexa· foedum porrigine? Quare,

Si quidvis satis est, perjurae, surripiS, aufers
Undique? Tun sanus ἓ Populum si caedere saxis
Incipias servosque tuos quos aere parariS,

In victum ergo vestem accipiemus non stra·
gula3 in stratu omnem stragulam vestem ’'
(Ulpian, quoted by For-cell. v. ⁴ stragulum ').
The ancients hed very expensive coverings
for their beds- They were usually purple,
wide, und sometimes richly embroidered.
“Multae stragulae vestes ¹ are reckoned
among the rich furniture of Heraclius of
Syracuse. (Cic. in Verr. ii. 2. 1⁴.) Com-
pare also ii. 4. 26, where Cicero says that
Verres hsd a wesving establishment for the
manufactum of these eoverlids in every
weulthy house in Sicily. One lady of Se-

dyed with the richest purple, throughout.
By wey of illusis-etius the reckless extrava-
g-ance os M. Antonius, Cicero says (Phil.
ii. 27) you might see the couches in his
slaves rooms covered with the purple
περιστρώματα that had belonged to Cn.
Pompeius. The affectsfion of Zoilus, who
pretends to be in, that he may have an
opportunity of displaying his bed and its
farnitum, is cleverly told· by Martia! (ii. 16)=

‘⁸ Zoilus κει-σίτοις faciunt hsce stragula
Si 1Ξέιῗοιιιοιὶῑῃεῖιιιιιο coccina quid facient?
Quid torus a Nilo? quid Sidone tinctus
Offitit? stultus quid nisi morbus
Quid οέιῗῖ 'cum medicis? dimitte Macha-
onas omnes.
Vis fieri sanus? stragula sume mew’

119. putrescat] There is no variation
in the MSS. here. Below (v. 194) the me-
jority and best are in favour of ⁴ putesco.'

(See note.)
121. morbo Jactatur eodem] That is
is applied

msdness. The word ‘jactari'
mediceily to the tossing of the sick and
&mago—f those in pain. See Lucretius

‘⁴ Haec igitur tantis ubi morbis corpore in
,1οέἑῖᾞὲ t ,miserisque modis distractu

123. Dis inimice senem] This is sn
adapntion of Θεοῖς ἐχθρός, a common
Greek expression. See Demos. (de Cor.
p. 120: κόλακες καὶ θεοῖς ἐχθροὶ καὶ
τᾶλλα, and p. 245, προδοτῶν καὶ δωρο-
δόκων καὶ θεοῖς ἐχθρῶν ἀνθρώπων.

127. perjuram] Other exsmples of this
form are given by Forcellini, who says the
best MSS. have ⁴ perjuro ’ in Cicero, where
⁶ pejero ’ is usually found in the editions. As
a compromise between the two forms, Orelli’s
best MSS. in this place have ⁴ pejurus!

129. servosque tuoe quos aere parav-isa
Bentley will lay any wsger (⁴ equidem ausim
quavis sponsione contendere ') Horace did
not write thus, but ⁸ servosve tuo quos aere
pararis.' ‘Tuo ' appears in Ascensius' text
and in s very few os Fee’s MSS. Ten.
Faber hss that word. All other MSS. and
editions till Bentley have ⁸ tuos3' ‘ ve' for

dern editors have adopted ⁸ tuo! Heindorf
has ‘tuos.' 1 do not see any great differ.

chose of slaves, employs himself in breaking
their hesds with stenes. Such a man, ssys
Stertinius, would be counted mad by eccle·
mation. ‘·Well, then,’ he adds to the
miser, ⁸ are you not med who poison your
mother or strsn le your wife, to get rid of
the expense os eeping them? Of course
not; for you do it, not at Argos, but st
Romu not in the ehmcter of Orestes, but
of a respectable citizen. But do you not
believe Orestes was mad before he killed
his mother, and when no one sus it 2’
