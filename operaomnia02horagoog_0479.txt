Ille repotia natales aliosve dierum

HORATII FLACOI

Festos albatus celebret, cornu ipse bilibri
Caulibus instillat, veteris non parcus aceti.
Quali igitur victu sapiens utetur, et horum
Utrum imitabitur? Hac urget lupae, hac came, aiunt.

Mundus erit qua non offendat sordibus, atque
In neutram partem cultus miser.

Albuti senis exemplo, dum munia didit
Saevus erim nec sic ut simplex Naevius unctam
Convivis praebebit aquam; vitium hoc quoque magnum.

Accipe nunc victus tenuis quae quantaque secum
Imprimis valeas bene t nam variae res

Afferat.

was usual for persons who were cenvsssing
for offices to heve their toga unusually
whitened with an extr· supply of ⁴ cretass
whence they were called ⁴ candidati! Theo·
phrastus (cham. περὶ μικρολογίας) speaks
of mean persons as πρὸς τοὺς γναφεῖς δια-

61. corma ipse bilibri] The ‘cornu'
was the horn vessel in which the oil was
kept. Instead of having a cruet or small
vessel suited to the dinner-table, such ns
wealthy people usually had of silvei· and
others of chesper material, he would bring
down the big horn, and with his own hand,
leet others should be too liberal, drop the
smallest quantity of oil upon the cabbege,
while of his old vinegar, which would turn
his maeste, if he had any, from the dish,
he was free enough. So that the reading
‘largus' for ‘parcus' which Gesner sup·
ports isout of place. It has little authority.

64. aiunt] τὸ λεγόμενον, ‘as the saying
is.' It was perhaps a common proverb,
though not now met with elsewhere. The

offend by meenness, and is on neither hand
sordid in his way of living!

67. Albuti cenis] See S. i. 48, n. What
more is given by the Scholiasts is hardly
worth repeating, for it is only drawn from
the text as any one may see. They say the

to an indifferenoe to the decendes of life, and
a want of consideration for others, which
some people almost look upon as a virute,
