Horace was e men of the world, with good sense and good breeding; he had ‘⁴ fides et
ingeni benigna vena,” intem-icy, end fine wit, and correct teste end judgment3 but he
was not a dithyrambic poet, end if he had been the language he wrote in would have
checked his genius, end brought down his ideas to the more practioel level above which

the Roman mind rarely σου-αἰ.

The article Dionysus in Smith’e Dict- Mythol. may be consulted, and will explain most

of the allusions' ιιι this ode.

4. Capn'pedum Satyrorum] The Satyrs
ere usually conflounded with the Fauna,
Faunus again being eonfounded with Pan,
who was represented with goat s feet like
the Satyrs. Pmpernnsin 1.7 34) speak-
ingoftheattendanbol uscallsthem
Panez‘ ‘capripedes calamo Penes hiante
αιιιειιίι.” Ovid (Met. i.193) makes the
Famae and Satyrs attend onthisgod, and
again (vi. 302, sq.)makee the Fenus end
Satyrs brothers, whereas Faunus was only
a latin deity. Lucina describes the Satyrs

“being ὀξεῖς τὰ ὦτα, but οιι1γ describes
Pan es having the lower exn-emities like a

goat, τὰ κάτω αἰγὶ ἐοικώς. It is vain
therefore trying to mee any consisteney
in the poets' oonoeptions of these uneouth
divinitiee.
9. Fae pervicaces eet] Bentley proposes
‘deit' for‘ est,' without authority or neoee-
(see Argument). ‘Fas est’ is equi-
va ent to δυνατόν ἐστι. The power as well
as the permission of the god is given·
“Fae nnnc non signifieat lieet sed posei-

· ωε ” (roma).
