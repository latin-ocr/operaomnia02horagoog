13. Non incisa] There is a little con-
fusion (which however is easily seen through
by those who avoid the commentators and
judge for themselves) in the lines that fol-
low. Horace means to say that the monu-
ments raised to heroes by their country and
their deeds themselves do not shed so much
honour upon them as the poet's verses do.
He illustrates the deeds of heroes by the ex-
ploits os the Scipiones, and the poet's verses

y the poem Ennius wrote in praise of the
Elder. lt is true that, if we knew nothing
of the destruction of Carthago but what is
here mentioned, we might suppose that the

n who destroyed it was celebrated by
nnius, snd confusion would ariae. But
as we do not suppose Horace was ignorant
that Carthago was burnt by Scipio Afri-
canus Minor, and that Ennius died many
years before that event, so neither would
Horace assume such ignorance in his
readers. When he says that the defeat
of Hannibal by the elder Scipio and the
destruction of Carthage by the younger,
do not hold up their name more nobly
than the muse of Calabria, who does
not supply in his own mind “ which was
employed in doing honour to the elder ?”
If, as Bentley says, every boy of ten years
old knows as much as this, so much the less
obscurity is there in the sentence. He pro-
poses to mend it by omitting altogether the
serenteenth verse, which,he says, halts in the
metra and confiises the suthor's meaning.
The remedy is simple; but the MSS. we
possess or have any record of all contain
that verse. The other remedies proposed
are to change ‘incendia' into some word
which shall not be inapplicable to the con-
quests of the elder Scipio, and Cunningham
has supposed ‘ impendia ⁹ to be the word,
Doering ‘ stipendia,' Hermann ⁸ dispendia,’
none of which are st all satisfactory. Thst
no word short of destruction (implying
therefore that the younger Scipio is meent)
existed in the copies of one of the Scholiasts
(Comm. Cruq.) may be infer-red from his
note, ‘⁶ quia contra foedus Juramento violato
Romanis rebellarunt.” Others suppose that

20

⁸ incendia ' does not necessarily mean the
burning os Carthago, but is onl‘y another
way of expressing the overthrow of its
power by the elder Scipio, or his burning
of the fleet, or os the camp of Syphax.
But, considet-ing the notoriety ef the final
destruction of that city by tire, this would
only be charging Horace with wantonly
confusing his readers. And yet it would
seem that the Scholiasta and the older com-
mentators all understand but one Scipio to
be referred to, and they must have under-
stood the line therefore in some way con-
sistent with such an interpretation. It must
not be overlooked that the verse ‘⁶ Ejus, qui,”
δια, applica to either of the Scipiones. An-
other remedy which is proposed is to sup-
pose that two verses have been lost aster
the seventeenth, which would have explained
its meaning; the ground of which hypo-
thesis is, that odes in this measure, of which
however there are but two others (C. i. l,
and iii. 30), are so written as to be capable
of division into stanzas of four lines each,
and this ode wants two verses to enable it
to meet that rule. But the rule is arbitrary,
and s precarious foundation for such an ss-
sumption as the loss of two verses, of which
no traces whatever are to be found in the
oldest MSS. and commentators. On the
whole 1 see no sufficient objection to the
verse to require its being omitted or branded
with asterisks, though the authority of
Buttmann, who thinks it spurious (Mytho-
logne, vol. ii. append. Horas und nicht-
Hom), will have weight, as it should.
But his objection is founded on the rhythm,
which 1 hardly think can be admitted as
sufficient ground. Baxter's note is more
sensible than his usually are: ‘⁴ Nollem
Bentleius ita se turbaret quod Horatius
Scipionum acta in unum fere coegerit poe-
tici compendii studiosus. Certe vel summis
poetis eJusmodi ἀνιστορησία leve admodum
est crimen.”

pressing his hasty departure fr0m Italy at
the summons of the carthaginian senate.
