Unde homines operum primos vitaeque labores
Instituunt, sic dis placitum, tu carminis esto
Principium. Romae sponsorem me rapiS. Eja,
Ne prior officio quisquam respondeat, urge.

19. Libitinae quaeriue acerbae-J The
goddess Libitina was one of the oldest
Roman divinities. Plutarch (Quaest. Ram.
23) speaks of her service being as old as
Numa, who identified her with Venus, in
order to bring together the beginning and
the end of human life, and he mentions an
Ἀφροδίτη Ἐπιτυμβὶα at Delphi. She was
also identified with Persephone. She pre-
sided over funerals and all things pertaining
to the dead. There were kept in her temple
(the site of which is not known) all manner
of things required at funerab, where the
undertakers (hence called Libitinarii) might
purchase or hire them. Also a register of
funerals was kept in the temple, and when
they were registered a fee was paid = hence
Suetonius, in his life of Nero (c. 89) speaks
of “ pestilentia unius Auctumni qua triginta
funerum millia in rationem Libitinae vene-
runt ;” one sickly autumn in which thirty
thousand funerals were entered i'n the
accounts of Libitina; and in Eusebius'
Chron. mention is made of an epidemic in
the time of Vespasiani “ lues ingens Romae
facta ita ut per multos dies in ephemeridem
decem millia ferme mortuorum hominum
referantur ;” where the ephemeris seems
to be the register in this temple. From
both the above sources the temple would
derive increesed revenues in a season of
great mortality. Horace twice uses the
name of Libitina as equivalent to Mors.
See C. iii. 30. 6: “magnaque pars mei
vitabit Libitinam ;” and Epp. ii. 1. 49: ‘⁴ mi-
raturque nihil nisi quod Libitina sacravit ;”
and Juvenal does the same (S. iv. 122)=
‘⁴ gam si Libitinam evaserit aeger Delebit
ta nlas.

20. Matutine putem] Janus was pecu-
liarly a latin divinity‚ and one of the oldest.
As he presided over the opening year, so he
did also over the beginning of every mouth
and of every day. Sacriflces were offered
to him on the first of every mouth, as well
as of his own (January), and prayer in the
morning of every day. Hence he is called
⁶ Matutinus pater ς’ and hence he is con-
founded with the Suu. ⁴ Pater ' was the
title by which he was commonly addressed,
and according to Gellius (v. 12) the two

words were joined thus, ‘Januspaten’ See
Epp. i. 16. 59, “Jane pater, clare, clare cum
dixit, Apollo.’' He was worshipped before
the other gods, which Ovid makes him
explain on the ground that he was the
medium through whom men got access to
the others :—

⁸⁴ Mox ego: Cur, quamvis aliorum numina
J ane, filblinssiffrio tura merumque fero ἓ
Ut per me possis aditum qui limina servo
Ad quoscungue velim· prorsus habere
deos. (Fast- 1. 171.)

⁴ Jane ’ is put in the vocative case by a sort
of attraction. §See C. ii. 20. 6, n.) ⁸ Audire:
in the sense o ‘appellari' ἀκουειν, occurs
again in Epp. i. 7. 37 :—

⁸⁶ -— rexque paterque
Audisti coram nec verbo parcius absens ;”

and 16.17, “Tu recte vivis si curas esse
ggffiuzuffi's „··(⁸s·?¹‘55¹{⁸0{3.‘“¹÷¹3.³2:¹:.i i}
not commonly used in this sense except
with ⁴ bene ' or ‘ male!

21. Unde] ‘From whom ' (C. i. 12. 17).

23. sponsorem me rapit] ⁸ Sponsor ’
was one who became security for another
under the form of contract called ‘ver-
borum obligatio‚' the conti-act taking place
by question and answer, ⁸ ex interrogatione
et responsione? One asked the other, “ Dari
spondes ?” and he anewered ⁶ spondeo!
The principale were mlled, ⁸ stipulator‚' he
who asked the question, and ⁸ promissor,’
he who answered. The sponsor was said
⁸ intercedere,' and to him the same question
was put, to which he returned the' same
answer (see Dict. Ant„ arte. ⁴ Intercessio,'
⁴ obligationes’). This explains ⁶ respondeat'
in v. 24, and ‘⁸ quod mi obsit clare certum·
qne locuw,” v. 27. He answers ⁸ spondeo ’
in a clear distinct voice, and becomes liable,
Wwffiffimmfflmffizi.

is passing in Horace’s own mind, as some
suppose, bnt more probably he means them
sor the words of Janus, to whom he ata-i-

butes the prompting of his real.
