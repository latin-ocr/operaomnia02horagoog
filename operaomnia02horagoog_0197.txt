Muniant angues caput ejus atque

Spiritus teter saniesque manet

Quin et Ixion Tityosque voltu
Risit invit0, stetit urna paullum
Sicca dum grato Danai puellas

Carmine mulces,

Audiat Lyde scelus atque notas 25
Virginum poenas et inane lymphae
Delium fundo pereuntis imo,

Seraque fata.

Non times detur 3 socerum et scelestas

Falle sorores,

German scholare (Orelli names ten, among
whom is Buttmann) heve rejected this utana
ee spurious, the description being considered

who object to ‘ ejus ’ is aptly quoted ι stin

inelegance :—
