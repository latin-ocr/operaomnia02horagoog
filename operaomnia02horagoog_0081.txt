Quodsi Threicio blandqu Orpheo

Auditam moderere arboribus fidem,

Non vanae redeat sanguis imagini²
Quam virga semel horrida

Non lenis precibus fata recludere

Durum : sed levius fit patientia
Quidquid corrigere est nefas.

6. Pudor et Iustitiae soror, — Fidem]
Pigures of these personsges sre found on
coins with various desa-iptive accompeni-
ments. The are associated sgsin C. S.
57. Cicero tle⁸ Off. i. 7) says, ‘⁶ Funde-
mentum sutem justitiae est fides, id eet
dictorum conventorumque consttutis et ve-
ritas.

8. inveniet] Most of the older editions
heve ⁴ invenient? but nearly ell the MSS.
sppesr to have ⁶ inveniet,’ end Bentley has
shown, bys lnge number of instances, thet
itis Horsoe's ususl practice to heve the verb
in the singular number efter several sub-
stantives es here. He seys thet it is never
otherwise except in corrupt passages, which
is his usual wey of begging the question.
In (Ξ. iii. 16. 7 all the MSS. heve ‘risis-
sent.

ll. Τιι frustra pius laea non ita cre-
ditum] ‘ It is vein, sissi thet with picus
prayers thou dost sek the gods to restore
Quinctilius, whom thou didst entrust to
their keeping‚ but not on these terms' (i. e.
that they should teke him swsy). Such is
Porphyrion’s explanation. Lambinus sud
Graevius understood ‘ non ite creditum’ to
moen that he wss not entrusoed to Virgil
οιι such ter-ms ss thst he was never to pert
with him. 1 prefer the firet3 but it is not
essy to ιιι] which is right.

13. Quodn] All the Berne MSS.. sud
Cruquius’‚ sud some others, heve ⁴ quid si,'
which some editore adopt, with the usual

Long’s note on cie. Verr. Act. 1i. l. 2. c. 7.)
But ‘ quodsi' is supported by good authority.
sud most of the editors heve adopted it. 1
heve no doubt it is right. Horace never uses
⁴ sin,’ which virgil uses as often und in tho
seme wey ss Horace usa ‘ quodsi),

15. frewine] ⁴ Imego ' was thet unsub-
stsntisl body in which the soul was eup-
posed to dwell efter desth, called by flio
Greeks εἴδωλον. Such were the forms that
Aeneas saw end thought them substantisl: —

‘⁴ Et ni· docte comes tenues sine corpore
Admtffi volitare csvs sub imagiueformse,
Irrust et frustra ferro diverberet umbi-⁸33⁹

Aen. vi. 292, sqq.

17. Non lenis precibus sata recludere
This Greek construction hes been noti

before (i. 18). The expression ⁶ feta reclu-

dere’ seems to meon ‘toppen the door of
hell when Fste hes closed it!

18. Nigro compulerit—frmi] ‘ Hes ge-
thered to the derk crowd.' The dative is
only admissible in poetry. S. ii. 5. 49 t
“ Si quis cesus puerum egerit Orco,’' for
⁴ sd Orcum.’

19. Durum .· sed levius] Donatus says
thet Virgil was much in the habit of com-
mending this virtue of patience, ssyiug thet
the hardest formnes might be overcome by
a wiso endursnce of them. Tberefore, says
Fabricius, Horace consoles Virgil with his
own philosophy.
