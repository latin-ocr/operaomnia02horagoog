EPISTOLARUM I. 16. 623

EPISTLE XVI.

Quintius, to whom this Epistle is addreesed, annot be identified with any known per-
son. The same nume is connected with the eleventh Ode of the second book ς but there
is no reason to suppose them to belong to one person. There is no more reason in the
Epistle than in the Ode why a name should appear at all ς for the subject is general, that
being the liability of men to be deoeivod in respect to their own goodness and that of
others, by the judgment of the multitude. This discourfle is added on rather abruptly
to a short desa-iption of Horaoe's reeidenoe, to follow which any body who 'ean get it
should read the Abb& capmartin de Chaupy'a ⁴ Deoouverte dela Maioon de Campagne
d’Horaoe,' printed nt Rome in 1767. It is written with great vivadty and intelligenoe,
though, us in such cases must always be expected, with a tendency to οἰκοίη his proofs
and to attempt more preciaion than the dramatancea admit of.

ARGUMENT.

To save you the trouble of asking about my estote, my good Quintius,—my oropo and
my olives, my orcha-ds, meadowe, and vines‚—-I will deam-ibe it to you at fun length.
Tbere is a chain of monntains broken by a shady valley, of which one side gets the
ruys of the morning sun, the other of the evening. ΤΙιο climate you would like 3 and
when 1 tell yon Ι have oornels and plume growing wssd, and oaks to give acorns to my
owine and shade to their master, you will think Tarentum has drawn nearer to Rome.
Then 1 have a stream that might be mlled a river, for Hebrus is not more clear or
oool, good for the head and good for the stomach. To these reti-eata, which 1 love,
and which are in truth delightful, you owe it that your friend is alive in September.

You too are counted a happy man: see that you be ³03 trust not to the judgment of
others bnt to your own of yourself, and remember that none but the sago is happy.
The people may think you sound, but if you are oonaeious of a sever in your veina do
not attempt to hide it. If any one talks of your wars in langmge that fits only
Augustus, you shrink from the lie; but when they eall you good and wise, do you not
accept the eompliment? well, say you, Ι like to be praised, as Ι suppose you
do yourself. But do you not know that they who give ean tuke away their pruine?
Give it back, say they, and you must do so. What if they eall me thies, pai-ridde, does
that effect me? Who but the vicinus care for false praise or falae blame? who in
the really good man? The vulgar will point to the correct man who keeps the laws
and is in favour in the courts, but his intimates may know him better. There are
some who do not sin for sear of punishment3 but the good man is good beoeuae he
loves goodness. Your good man who is so looked up to when he saa-ifioeo has hie
silent prayer to J anua, Apollo, Laverna, that they will promote and hide his hiavery.
1 cannot see wherein he is better than the poor slave who stopo to pick up an as from
the pavement. He who crues will sear3 and he who seara is not a free man in my
judgment. He has desei-ted the ranks of virtue who is ever busied in making money. .
Sell him for ο slavez he ia fit for that3 whereas the suge oen sayto his tyrant ‘⁸ take all
1 have, put me in bondo if you wilh bnt when 1 please, heaven will eet me free 3⁹⁹ for
he thinks thus ε ⁰⁴ 1 ean ᾱίος and death iu the goul of all things.”
