OARMEN XIX.

Glycera (Γλυκέρα) is one of Horace’s favour-ite names. She is set down asthe Cinara of
C. iv. 13. 21 (see n.), bnt with what show of reason beyond their having the same number
of syllables, it is not easy to see. We need not take Horace too much at his word when
he says that his days of love were over. Many a young sentimentalist has imagined this
and found himself mistaken as the poet appears to have done. These who chooseto insist
that Horace is confessing on his own account that ‘⁴ the heyday of his blood was tamed,”
put this ode rather late, A.u.c. 729 or 730. Others find in the allusion to the Parthian
(v. 12) occasion to fix the date a few years later (734 or 735) when the standards of
Crassus had been recovered from that troublesome enemy. This important epoch is ever
before the minds of one section of the chronologiam: ‘⁴ dies noctesque quidam veluti
spectris territi cogitassent de signis et captivis a. 734 a Parthis Augusto redditis,” says
Franke, whose acumen, however, while it has led him on the whole into a more consistent
and probable chronological scheme than Kirchner and others, is not above being misled
by too much zeal sor its own inventione. 1 should be no more disposed with him to say
Horace wrote this ode while the Arabian expedition (i. 29) was pending, than with his
adversaries that he wrote it five or six years later. When or under what circumstances
or to whom (if any body) he wrote, wc must be content to be ignorant. (See C. iv. 1,
Introduction.)

ARGUMENT-

The mother of love, Semele’s son, and wantonnees remll my heart to love 1 thought 1 had
put away sor ever. 1 burn for Glycera purer than marble, and that mischievous sace
so dangerous to look upon. With all her strength hath Venus come upon me, and
bids me sing no more of idle themes, the Scythian and the Parthian. Build me an altar,
slaves, bring boughs and incense and wine, for 1 would sosten the goddess with a vicfim.

Mum saeva Cupidinum
Thebanaeque jubet me Semeles puer
Et lasciva Licentia
Finitis animum reddere amoribus.
Urit me Glycerae nitor 5
Splendentis Pario marmore purius;
Urit grata protervitas
Et voltus nimium lubricus adspici.
In me tota ruens Venus
Cyprum deseruit, nec patitur Scythas 10
