21. Proeliis auda-r] It will be resdily
scen that Horace confounds the Latin divi-
· nity Liber with the Greek Dionysus or
Bacchus, whose Indisn wsrs and contest
with the glauts (ii. w. 21) are here alluded
ιο. Bentley puts a stop aster these words
and applica them to Pallas.

much disputati whether this refers to Tar-
quinius Priscus or Superbus. But for the
epithet applied ιο ⁴ fasces ' there could
be no doubt. The Scholiasta suppose Pris-
cus to be the person alluded to, end more
editors hold that opinion than the other.
These who contend for· Superbus quote
Cicero Phil. iii. 4, where comparing this
king with M· Antonius he makes him out to
bebetter than history draws him. But Cicero
ι lte for a purpose, and his statements are
c iefly negative. On another occasion he
wrote differently. tuing, ‘⁴ Quis est qui-

(De Am. 8). It may be admitted however
that the propriety of all the names in this
catalogue of worthies is not obvious. why

The place in which Cato’s name is mm-
tioned is also an offence to some, and
Bentley wishes ιο sweep him out altogether,
and substitute Curtius, reading ‘ anne Curti’
for ⁴ an Catonis! But as he has made no
conver-ts, and does not adopt his own con-
jecture, it is not necessary ιο meddle with
his argument. We must be content to take
the names Horace has given us, and as te
Tan-quin the render must judge for himself.
