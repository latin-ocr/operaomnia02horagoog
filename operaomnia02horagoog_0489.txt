to have come into the country prepared to

roduce something worthy of his fame.
ΞἰῚιο books he would bring with him would
be of a kind suited to his purpose, which
the writings os the comediam and of Archi-
lochus, the bitterest of all satir-ists, would
be. 1 do not see what Plato, the philo-
sopher, has to do with Menander, Eupolis,
and Archilochus, or the doeign for which
Horace is supposed to have carried them
into the country with him. Plato’s come-
dies were greatly admired by his contem-
poraries. Their character also in some in-
stances approximated to that of the New
Comedy. Plato is on this account asso-
ciated with the so-called Middle Comedy;
and so if we take Menander to represent
the new, and Eupolis the old, we shall have
all the three stylos of Greek comedy here
assembled. 1 observe by Orelli’s note that
C. Passow understands ⁸ Platona ' ιο mean
the writer of comedies. Dacier did tho
same. 1 am inclined to agree with them.
⁴ 'santos ’ Acron refers to the size of the
volumes, Orelli to the greatness of the
writers. Perhaps Horace meant both ε
διλόγως, as Baxter would say.

13. virtute relicta ἵ] 1 have more than
once had occasion to remark that the notion
of perseverance is involved in the Roman
⁴ virtus’ (See C. S. 59), and it is so here,
being opposed to ‘ desidia ' (v. 15). But it
means more, for it implies moral courage
and a strong will, which were in great esteem
among the Romans. Damasippus supposes
the poet to be consulting his ease and his
cowardioe at the same time; and says if he
thinks to silence jealousy by oeasing to
write, he will only find himself the object
of contempt3 and if he means to be idle
now, he must be content to lose the re-
pumtion won in his better days of energy.
As to ⁴ Siren‚' see Epp. i. 2. 23.

16. Damasippe,] See Introduction.
Horace prays, in the words of a common
formula, that heaven will send Damasippus,

to reward him for his good advice, a barber
to shave his long heard. He may be sup-
posed to have let his beard grow long with
the affectation peculiar to those who mlled
themselves philosophas, and Horace means
that to be delivered from that folly would
be the best boon that could be bestowed
upon him. (See below, v. 35, and note on
S. i. 3. 133.) Aulus Gellius (N. A. ix. 2)
tells a story, of which he was au eye-witnoes,
of a man going ιο Herodes Atticus, ‘⁴ pal-
liatus et ‹xi-initus barbaque prope sd pubem
usque porrecta‚” and asking him for money
to buy bread. When he was uked who he
was, he answered in a tone os reproach that
he was a philosopher, aud that he was sur-
prised that Atticus should ask a question
which his own eyes would enable him to
answer. The good man's reply was, “ Video
barbam et pallium ς philosophum nondum
video.” ἐκ πώγωνος σοφοί was the Greek
way of representing such persons,—men
whose wisdom lay in their beai-«is.

18. Ionum Ad mediam] There appear
to have been three arches dedicated to
Janus in the Forum Romanum, one at each
end, and one in the centro, near to the Arma
Fabianus at the extremity of the Via Sacra.
They are alluded to again Epp. i. l. 54:
‘⁴ Haec Janus summus ab imo Perdocet;”
i. e. the whole Forum. Near the middle
arch were the ‘ tabernae ’ of the principal
money-londers- Cicero mentions them (de
Off. ii. 25): “de quaerenda, de collocanda ·
pecunia, vellem etiam de utenda commodius
a quibusdam optimis viris ad Janum medium
sedentibus, quam ab ullis philosophis ulla in
schola disputatur.”

20. Olim nam] This position of ‘nam’
is peculiar to the poets. See below, v. 41,
and elsewhere.

21. vafer — lavisset Sisyphus Μὴ]
Homer (11. vi. 153) calls Sisyphus κέρδιστος
ἀνδρῶν. Damasippus says he used, before
he lost all his money, to employ himself
in purchasing and re-selling all kinds of
