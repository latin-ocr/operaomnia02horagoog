Cum res ipsa feret.

HORATII FLACOI

Nisi dextro tempore Flacci

Verba per attentam non ibunt Caesaris aurem,

Oui male si palpere recalcitrat undique tutus.”

“ Quanto rectius hoc quam tristi laedere versu
Pantolabum scurram Nomentanumque nepotem,

, Cum sibi quisque timet, quamquam est intactuS, et odit !”

“ Quid faciam? Saltat Milonius, ut semel icto

Accessit fervor capiti numerusque lucernis.

Castor gaudet equis, ovo prognatus eodem
Pugnis ; quot capitum vivunt, totidem studiorum
Milia: me pedibus delectat claudere verba
Lucili ritu nostrum melioris utroque.

Ille velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim

Credebat libris, neque si male cesserat unquam
Decurrens alio, neque si bene3 quo fit ut omnis
Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella

Vita senia.

18. dea-tro tempore] See below, S. 4. 4:
“ cum te sic tempore laevo Interpellarim.''

22. Pantolabum] S. i. 8. 101.

24. Maenium] When the Scholiasta
know nothing about a man of this sort they
usually call him a ‘ scurra‚’ a parasite, a low
fellow who has no respect for himself, who
lets himself out at the price of a dinner ω
entertain rich people and their gnests with
buffoonery and small talk. This man, as
soon as the wine gets into his head, would
get up and dance before the company, the
lowest proceeding in the eyes of a Roman
that could be imag-ined. Cicero (pro Mur.
c. 6) says it iswronginCatoto calla
Roman consul a ‘dancerz'
saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit,” and he
calls it “omnium vitiorum postremum. ''
⁸ Icto,’ in this sense of ⁸ wine-struck,' is ex-
pressive, but does not occur elsewhere. It
is a Greek notion. Juvenal graphically
describes the effect of tipsiness in doubling
the candles and putting every thing out of
its place (vi. 304) :—

“ Cum bibitur concha, cum jam vertigine
tectum

Ambfflgth et geminis exsurgit mensa lucer-

“ Nemo fere

26. C'aetor qaudet aquia] This difference
in the tastes of Castor and his brother is
expressed in one line of the Iliad (iii. 237),
Κάστορά θ’ ἱππόδαμον καὶ πὺξ ἀγαθὸν
Πολυὸεὕκεα. On what follows the Scho-
liasta quoto the well known sentence of

Sequor hunc, Lucanus an Apulus anceps:

Terence, ‘⁸ Quot homines tot sententiae3
suns cuique mos '⁹ (Phormio, ii. 4. 14).

the Scholiasta have extr-acted an allusion to
Lucilius' ancestral connexion with Cn. Pom-
peius, whose great uncle he is said ω have
been. The description of Lucilius' affection
for his books, his companions in cheersnl-
ness and in sorrow, to whom he communi-
cated as to sympathizing friends his most
seoeet thoughts, and through whom his
whole inner life was laid open to the world,
is gracefiil and touching. It must have
satisfied any reasonable person who had

his remarks on the old poete.

33. Vama—tabella] On the practice
of hanging up a picture in the temples to
commemorate escape from shipwreck, see
C. i. 5, 12, n. It was probably not con·
fined to sailors. J uvencius says, 1 do not
