10. The Genauni were one of the southern
tribes of Raetia lying between the lakes
Verbanus Maggiore) aud Larius (Come)
in the mo ern Val d'Agno. Tine Breuni
Cramer also places south of the Alps in the
Val Braunia3 others place them higher up
among the modern Grisous, between the
sources of the Rhine and the Oenus (Iun).
But at any rate the Grisons oceupy a larg-er
portion of the ancient Raetia than that
which belonged to the Breuni, a small
though a warlike tribe. Pliny has preserved
an inscription from a trophy set up in oue of
the Alpine towns on this occasion: ‘⁸ rur.

character Horace gives of these tribes is
that which is given by all writers of the
time. ⁴ Implacidum ’ is a word not found
in any writer earlier than Horace. Itis as
likely that he made as that he found it:
either may be true. Velleius, in his account
of this war, speaks of ‘⁸ multas urbium et
castellorum oppugnationes ” in the course
of it, aud says it was carried on ‘⁴ majore
33:3²» Ρὲῗῑῗὲᾟὲἓῗᾱῖἶωοῖἓξῖἳέἓ ἷέῖῖῗξῑ
of Horace. ⁶ Plus vice simplici' the Scho-
liasts Porph. and Comm. Cruq. explain ιο
mean ‘with greater advantage ou his side
thau the enemy’s,' he being ⁶ sine clade
victor' (v. 32). The literal version would
thus be, ⁴ with more thau an even exchange:
ι’. e. os blood. Some persons, aster Lam-
binus, understand it to mean more than
once. Gesner suggests that ⁸ vice ¹ may be
equivalent to ⁴ periculo,' but 1 believe the

20

Scholiasts ιο be right, though the words
are not free from difficulty. As ιο the
construction ⁸ plus vice,' see C. i. 13. 20.

17. Spectandur— Quantis] This seems
imitated from the Greek idiom θαυμαστὸς
ovete.

20. Indomitos prope qualit] Bentley
proposed ‘ indomitus ' because the harassed
Raetians could not properly be compared ιο
the untamed waters. One Me. has been
found ιο support him. The wonder is in
such a case that there are not more. Resides
the sup rt given ιο ‘indomitas ’ bytheMSS„
it may bg observed, that the fourth verse of
the Alcaie stanna is frequently count-ueteri
with a noun and its adjective in the first
and last place, and correspondiug in their
last syllables. In this ode we have vv. 12,
16, 20, 36. 52, answering ιο this rule or
habit. ⁶ Prope ’ has no particular force.
Peerlkamp says it weakens the sentence,
and Orelli says there is some truth in that
censure. Horace, whose ear was familiar
with the lan e os the Greek tragediaus,
copied their σχε όν τι (a common phrase in
eomparisons) without being couscious that it
weakened his verse, if it does so. He repeats
the phrase S. ii. 3. 268. The setting of the
Pleiades, at the beginning of November,
was reckoued as the commencement of
winter3 they therefore are said to burst the
clouds (scindere nubes), which poured down
rain upon the earth. Jani and others iu-
ter-pret the passage as referring to the rising
of the Pleiades iu May, when their approach
dispels the last clouds of winter, and the
south wind blows its last sturm. Gener
