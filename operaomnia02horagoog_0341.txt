HORATII FLAOOI

J AM jam efficaci do manus scientiae,

Supplex et oro regna per Proserpinae,

Per et Dianae non movenda numina,

Per atque libros carminum valentium

Refixa eaelo devocare sidera, 5
Canidia, parce vocibus tandem sacris

Citumque retro solve, solve turbinem.

Movit nepotem Telephus N ere'ium,

In quem superbus ordinarat agmina

Mysorum et in quem tela acuta torserat.

some respectable MSS. to ⁸ defixa,’ which

8. Movit nepotem] How Telephus, the
king of Mysia, was wounded and astemards
hesled by Achilles (the son of Thetis, aud
so grandson of Nereus), is told m the life of
Telephus in Smith' s Dict. Biog. He op·

osed the Greeks on their way to Tro.

portius refers to the story (ii. 1. 63) :—

has a long note in its defenee, but in his
