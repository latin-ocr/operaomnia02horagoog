ARGUMENT.

Stewurd of my dear woods and fields, which you despise, though five respectable familias
they maintain, und send up as many good fathers to Varia, let us see which ean root
out the thome quickest, you from the soil, or 1 from my bremt, md whether Horace
or his land is best. Lamia’e sorrow keeps me here, but my heu-t yearns to be where
you are. 1 love a country life, you love a town3 and of course he who envies another’s
lot dielikes his own. Each lays the blame on the place he is in, whereas the fault ie
in his own breast. While yon were a common slave in the town you used to sigh for
the country; now yon long for the town. 1 um consistent, u you know, and am loth
to depurt when business forces me to Rome. Our testes are different. What you call
a desert 1 cell a beautiful landscape, und what you think beautiful 1 dielike. You long
for the brothel and greasy tuvern, and dancing to a wanton’s music, decbring that that

palu-y place of mine would u econ bear pepper as the grape3 and yet with all thie
dulness you must work forsooth at the hai-dest of soils, und look after the oxen, and

attend to the river banks, and eo forth. Yon know the gay man 1 πως now 1 like
nothing but simple fare in a plain country way, end though 1 like my mereufion 1
should be ashamed to be always at play. No envy pureuee me into the country, though
my neighbours good humouredly quiz me in my new character of farmer. But you
had rather go back to your city ratione, while the stable boy is envying you your loge
and your flocks and your gurdon, just ee the ox longe for the saddle, and the horae for
the plough. 1 advisa each to mind the business he under-stands.

1. Villiee silvarum] The‘ villicue’ was municipium, as perhaps it was, they may
one of the principat slaves in the‘ familia have gone up on town business. Some sup-
pose they were ‘coloni' (C. ii. 14. 12, n.,)
leseees who fax-med different parts of the
estate. Varia, according to the Tabula
Theodosiana, wne thirty miles from Rome
end ten from Tibur, on the Via Valeria.
It was four miles from Horace'e ferm. Its

hed charge of every thing but the cattle, of
which there was a separate superintendent.
Horace says his woods and fields restored

him to himself3 that is, they gave him
liberty and enjoyment of life.

2. habitatum quinque focis] ⁶ Focis ’ is
put for ⁴ humilies) Horace says there lived
on his estate five familiee, the heads of
which were good men, who went up from
time to time to the neighbouring town of
Varia, Orelli supposes, to elect local officere
or to attend the mar-ket. 1f Varia was a

modern name in Vico Varo.
