and perverted ingenuity. Orelli, who was not wanting in respect
for Bentley, says, ‘⁶ conjecturae summi critici, etsi semper sagaces
et acutae, admodum raro a circumspecto Gritico probari nunc
possunt '.'' Nor do I think he is much more happy, in most in-
stances (especially in the Odes), in his choice of readings than in
his conjectures. He was always liable to be misled by want of ear
and poetical teste, as well as by the excess of a prurient sagacity⁸
and an unbounded egotism. The text in this edition will be found to
differ less from Orelli's than from any other. Where it does so the
reason is, Ι think, always given in the notes. He collated some
excellent MSS„ especially three in the library at Berne, of which
the oldest he places at the end of the eighth century or the be-
ginning of the ninth, and the other two in the tenth. His other
MSS. were one of St. Gallen nearly complete, and another of
Ziirich containing the Odes, Epodes, and Ars Poetica‚ both of
which he says are of the tenth century. Other MSS. referred to
in these notes are the Vatican and other Roman MSS. collated ΒΥ
Fea (l8ll); twenty-three MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris
collated by Pottier (1823), varying in age from the tenth to the
thirteenth century; and sundry others quoted with or without
name ΒΥ Lambinus (1577⁴)‚ Oruquius (1611⁸)‚ Torrentius (1608⁴),
and Bentley (1711). Of the last the most important are four
collated by Oruquius, and known as the Blandinian MSS. belonging
to the monks of a Benedictiue monastery in Flanders, and which
were very soon afterwards destroyed with the monastery by fire.
The oldest of these, which is appealed to as a great authority, but
which was certainly more often wrong than right in the instances
in which Gruquius quotes it, was said to be earlier than the ninth
century. On the margin of this MS. Oruquius found some old
notes, which, as he says, with infinite pains he deciphered‚ and he
