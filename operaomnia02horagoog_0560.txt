SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 7.

Ponere, teque ipsum vitas, fugitivus et erre,
J am vino quaerens, jam somno fallere curam:

Frustra; nam comes atra premit sequiturque fugacem.”

‘⁴ Unde mihi lapidem 3''—“ Quorsum est opus 3''-“ Unde sagittas3”
‘⁴ Aut insanit homo aut versus facit.'' “ Ocius hinc te
Ni rapiS, accedes opera agro nona. Sabino.”

19, which, sud other places of Horace there
mentioned, may be compared with this.
'I'he differenoe between ⁴ fugitivus ' and
⁴ εει-ω’ is explained by Ulpian (Dig. 21. 1.
17), quoted by Foroemni, under the latter
word. The whole punge ise ‘⁶ Erronem
definit Labeo pusillum fugitivum esse, et ex
diverso fugitivum magnum erronem esse,
sed proprie erronem sic definimus qui non
quidem fugit sed hequenter nine cuum
vagatur, et temporibus in res nugatorias
consumptis serius ud dominum redit.”
That is, a ⁸ fugitivus’ is ι slave who runs
away outright3 au ⁸ erro ' was tn idle
fellow who skalked out of the way to escape
work or to amuco himself. There was the
nme distinction in the army between ⁴ de-
sertor “and ⁴ emansor! A ‘fugitivus’ was
branded on the forehcad, and hence he was
termed ‘literatum’ ⁴ notatus,' ‘inscriptus,’
‘stigmosus3’ ⁶ stigms’ being the word to
express the mark thus given. See above,
