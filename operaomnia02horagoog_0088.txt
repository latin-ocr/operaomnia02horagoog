CARMINUM 1. 28. 63

appealtohisjudgment in v. l4,ithas been proposed to alter ‘te’ into ‘me’ or ‘se,'
though most even of those who divide the colloquy at v. 6 have overlooked this difficulty,
and accepted ‘ te ' on the authority of the MSS. But ⁴ nauta ’ is not properly a common
aailor, but ‘navicularius,’ a shipmaster. ‘⁴ Nautam accipere debemus eum qui navem exercet.
Quamvis nautae appellantur omnes qui navis navigandus causa in nave sunt, aed de exer-
‹a'tore solummodo Praetor sentit ’' (Dig. 4. 9. 1. ς 2). The ⁴ exerdtor’ is the person
who chartei-s the ship. There does not seem to be any natural division at v. 16, and for
Archytas to begin (at v. 21) with ⁴ Me quoque devexi,’ διο.. nothing having gone before
with which ιο connect those words, is also uunatura13 while, if we understand him to
begin his reply at ⁴ Sed omues una manet nox,' we have an opposition between the
sarcum of the first speaker (who says ironieally of those that aspired to connexion with
the gods aud to the highest order of wisdom that they had not escaped death, not even
Pythagoras, though he pretended to have done so once) and the grave (ruth, solemnly
propounded by the philosopher, that all must die, vise and unwise, old and young, on
land or at aea, and illustrated by his own case. This was once my opinion, and as many
will still adher-e ιο the theory of the dialogus and Archytas' ahipwreek, Ι have put that
theory in what appears to me the best form. The other explanation of the ode, however,
I feel little doubt, isin the main the true one. Another to which Orelli inclined (though
he suspended his judgment on the whole question) supposes a sailor coasting along the
Apuliau shore aud seeing the tomb of Archytas, wheneupon he breaks out into the
address ⁸ Te maris‚' δια, from v. 1 ιο 20. Then the ghost of a lately ahipwrecked man
comes forward and prays for a little saud. It would be difficult to imagine any circum-
stances that could have suggested such a scene, especially with so abrupt a change of
persons. The sudden apparitiou of a ghost echoing back to the mai-iuer at sea his own
words to my mind appears almost ludim-eus.

One difficulty appears to me to be fatal to the notion of a dialogus, and that is con-
tained in the second and third verses, in which it appears to be clearly intimated that the
body of Archytas has already received that which he is supposed ao earnaetly to pray for=
sor though many, 1 amavere, get over this difficulty by suppoaing ⁶ cohibent munera' to
mean that the want qsthe scanty gistof a little earth was keeping him back from his
rest, 1 do not see how the words will bear that sense3 nor can 1 translate ⁶ cohibent’
with Dillenbr. and others, as if it was meant that his body occupied but a small space on
the surface o! the ground. The words ean only mean that he was under the saud,
whether partially or otherwise, and in either case he would not require duat to be cast
three times on him.

This consideration, as well as the unity and simplidty it gives to the ode, has iuduced
me, with much confidenee, ιο adopt the explanation Ι have given. The propriety of a
sea-faring person being appealed to consiste iu his being exposed ιο risk of the same
fatewiththepersonwho appealstohim.

ARGUMENT.

Even thee, thou measurer of earth and sea, thou counter os thesands, Archytas, howsmall
a portion of earth contains thee nowl It profits thee not to have searched the air aud
traversed the heavens since thou wert to die. So Tantalus, Tithonus, and Minos have
died, and Pythagoras too with all his learning heth gone down once more to the grave.
But so it is: all must die alike; some ιο make apert for Mars, some swanowod up in
the deep: old and young go crowding to the gravet none escape: 1 too have per-iahed
in the waters. But grudge me not, thou mariner, a handful of earth: so may the storin
spend itself on the woods while thou art safe and thy merehandize increases. Is it a
small matter with thee to bring ruin on thy children? Yea, perhaps retribulion awaite
thyselsz my curses will be heard, and then no atonement shall deliver thee. ’Τίς hut
the work of a moment—thrice cast earth upon me and hasten on.
