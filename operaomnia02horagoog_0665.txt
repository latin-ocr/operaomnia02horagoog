Conticuit lyra.

Surge et inhumanae senium depone Camenae,
Coenes ut pariter pulmenta laboribus empta;
Romanis sollemne viris opus, utile famae

Vitaeque et membris, praesertim cum valeas et

Vel cursu superare canem vel viribus aprum
Possis. Adde virilia quod speciosius arma
Non est qui tractet: scis, quo clamore coronae
Proelia sustineas campestria; denique saevam

brothers, the sons of Antiope by Zeus,
were different in their dispositions, the one
being given to music, and the other to
country pursuits. Euripides and Pacuvius
each wrote a play called Antiope, the former
of which is referred ιο by Plato (Gorg-ias,
p. 485) in connexion with s disputo of
these brothers. Zethus it appears had a
contempt for Amphion's lyre, and advised
him roughly to throw it away, snd take to
arms, snd to useful pursuits, like his own.
Cicero alludes to Pacuvius' play (de Orat.
ii. 37)· “Miror cur philosophiae sicut
Zethus ille Pacuvianus bellum indixeriml'

Propertius contrasts the brothers as· ⁴-du

rum Zethum et lacrimis Amphiona mol-
lem '’ (iii. 15. 31); and the Scholiast on
Hesiod (Theogonis 60) says, Ἀμφίων καὶ
Ζῆθος αδελφοὶ μὲν ἦσαν, ἑτερόζηλοι δὲ

γεγόνασι ταῖς προαίρεσι. See the fiag-
ments of Euripides play in Deindort's

collection (Poet- Sc. Gr. .,82 sqq.) for
further notices of these brothers.

The following line is merely a fleur-ish of
flattery like this about the madar-ds. Au·
gustus had no intention of extending the
Roman empire at this time, and had no
occasion to do so if the Parthi-mm
humbled, which they were not. No further
conquest was attempted till A. ιι .c. 7ae,
when some of the Alpine tribes were beata
by Drusus and Tiberius, sml their coun
made into a province. See c.iv.4‚1nt.
The great majority of SS. have· refigit

The present tense is relied upon for fixing
the date of the Epistle. See Introduction.
