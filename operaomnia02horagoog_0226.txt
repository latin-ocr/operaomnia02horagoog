Seu Graeco jubeas trocho
Seu malis vetita legibus alea,

Cum perjura. patris fides
Consortem socium fallat et hospitem

Indignoque pecuniam
Heredi properet.

57. Seu Graeco jubear trocho] On the
use of the trochus see Smith' s Dict. Aut..
where will be found engrsvings of three
gems illustr-eting the practice very clearly.
The hoop was of metu-l, end it was guided
by ιι rod with s hook st the end, such as
boys commonly use now.

58. vetita legibue alem] There were lnws
at Rome, us therenrewith ns, against gum-
ing, which practice was nevertheless very
prevalent among all classes· ιιι the degenerem
times of the repnblic end the empire. J u
venal complains that young gchildren learnt

it from their fathers (xiv. 4)-

“si damnose senem juvat eles ludit et
Bul-ilusgus, parvoque eedem movet arms fri-
Msrtisl hes many references to this vicinus
habit, which hed scope allowed it et the
summulis ι
“ Dum blanda vagus eles December
Incertis sonat hinc et hinc fritillis
Et ludit popu nequiore tulo.”

(Epp. iv. 14. 7, sqq.)
Cicero charges M. Antonius with perdoning
one Licinius Lenticula, who hed been con-
demned for gaming, end with whom Anto-
nius, who, if we ere to believe Cicero, wasa

great gembler, had been in the habit of·

playing: ‘⁴ Hominem omnium nequissimum
qui non dubitaret vel iu foro eles ludere
lege quse est de elea condemnatum· ιιι inte-
grnmrestituit” (Phil. ii. 23). SeeDict.
Ant. srt.‘ elea!

‘consortes'

60. oon-nortem socium]
sometimes stands for ‘coheirsz’ “Sors et

patrimonium significet, unde consortes di-
ffiss‘eetus sugit). He also explains
m.. ωέῑζιζνῖ 'iissnssopriffimmm'mffi
meaning in Cic. in Verr. ii. 3. 23: “Quum

tres fratres consortes perfugissent,

quidem consors. ” Bentley understsnds the
word ιιι this sense here, following Decier,
end proposes to insert‘ et' between⁴ con-
sortem’ end‘ socium.' There is no MS.
authority for this reading, end the meaning
of‘ consors' is not confined to co· heirship.

‘Consortem socium' seems to mean the
pertner whose capitul was emberked with
his own. The Romans held it to be ιι very
serious offence for a. men to chent his part-
ner. Cicero (pro Rosc. Am. c. 40) says

‘in rebus minoribus fellere socium turpis-
simum estss' And again,⁴ ‘recte igitur ms-
iores eum qui socium fefellisset ιιι bonorum
virorum numero non putarunt haberi opor-
tere? Also, in his speech for Rooeins the
phyer, he says (c. 6),ι ‘seque enim perfidio-
sum et nefarium est fidem frangere
continet vitam, et pupillum fmudnre qui in
tutelam pervenit, et socium fallere qui se in
negotio conjunxit‚'' which lut words seem
to explsin⁴ consors. ' Horace couples these
two last crimes in Epp. ii. 1. 1232

⁴⁴ Non fraudem socio puerove incogitat ul-
Ριιιιεζὶᾞο.υ

Cicero de cl. Oret. c. 1) unitos in another
sense orece’s two words: ‘⁶ socius et con·
sors gloriosi laboris.” If Bentley hed
thought of this passage, he would have in-
serted‘ et' “vel centum codicibus invitis.”

‘Hospites' is the reading of many good
MSS.. sud Bentley adopts it. There is
more uniformity' ιιι the singular.

62. improbae] This is one of the most
difficolt words to which to assign its proper
menmng. Forcellini gives three or four
seperate heeds with quotations illustr-stiva
of esch, under any one of which most of
the exemples ιιι the others might be classed.
Orelli has quoted instances (on C. iii. 9.
22)· ιιι which it is applied to labour, a. Jnck-
dew, a. men, e mountain, a tiger, winter,
end the Adriatic See. He might have
added others: see Index. It implies‘ ex-

quae

” cess? end that excesu must be expressed
