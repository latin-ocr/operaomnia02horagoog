Horace wrote. He wss consul Α..ιι 3
(Clinton, F. H..) Orelli adopts the form
4’ΐοειοο ιιι preference to⁴ festus? ss being,
he says, more ancient. ⁴Fastib’us' occurs
in Lucan (x.187);and Priscian (vi. 14)
says, that both forms have been found by
him ιιι this passage· of Horace. The words
occur-again in C. iv. 14. 4= “Per titulos
megoffiujlefa‘f'htqrzisthereudm' gof ull the

to be governed by⁴ genusss und Bentley
warmly supports that reading. But there
is no necessity to desert the 81188. What
Horace says is nearly as follows, ‘Since‚ as
itis reportedff our early ancestors declared
they were deseended from lamus, sud the
sume tradition hus come down through their
successore in the ennnls of the family, no
doubt you drnw your origin from that dis-
tinguished
thing more than s little jocula- 1rony, which
would amuse Lamia whether it plen-sed his
family pride or not. That the pronoun 4ἰιι
ought to appear in opposition ιο4 priores'

both Latin and Greek, often omit the per-
sonal pronoun, even when it is wanted for
emphasis, asin C. i. l. 35,4 ⁴Quodsime

emphatically addressed, md in C. iv. 2.

Horace himself. ⁴ Quando et ' sufficiently

mukes the opposition here.
