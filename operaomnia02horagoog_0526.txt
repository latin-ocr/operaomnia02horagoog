SA TIBARUM 11. 5. 501

epee omnium tendente voto-'⁹ Petronius (sat. 124) speaks of finding “turbem here-
dipetarum ” et Crotona. He wrote in the reign of Tiberius.

Duentzer celle thie Βοιαὶ-ο “ felicissime fictio.’' Dna‘er thinks nothing could be more
ingenious ⁴⁸ que le tour qu’il donne ἰ cette satire, ni plus heureux que le choix dee
actem-e qu'il introduit.” The extravegnnee of the enechmnism md the incongruit!
of the perrone heighten the absurdity, but do not help the satire, te fer ae 1 een eee.
Homer (Odyee. xi.) mekee ulysse· go down to Hedee end there meet Telresiae the
Theben prophet, who tells him of the hardnhips that aweited him in his Journey home,
where however in the end he ie deefined ιο urive. Horace suppone· a confirmation of the
interview end makes Ulyseee ask the eoothreyer how he is to repeir hie fortunee when he
gete home, and finds his property meod by his wife’e enitere, ae the prophet told him
it would be (see note on v. Β). Tenedus, though he impliee thet the cunning Ulyesoe
wouldheet no lose in euehemetterifheonoe gothome‚givee himhin advice, which ie to
lay himself out for pleeeing old men end women of fortune, md getting named in their
wille, for which he lays down e few ordinary rulee, of which ο, persever-ing end course eer-
vility is the chief, euch ee Penipleetomenea describes in the Miles Gloriosus, iii. 1. 110,
sqq. Ulyeeee appears in ee low e character ee he cem—an apt diedph, ready ιο be the
ehedow ose slave, and to prostitutae hie charte Penelope if need be. The Ulyeeee of 211

thet Penelope, whose charaeta in the Odyssey is feminine end pure, ie hy later nitere
represented ee lese ohnete‘ then Homer hu drawn her. Thone who only know ha· ae the
virtuoue wife md mother, wm not easily forgive the course allusione to her in thie Satire-
Senndon and Decier are anxious it should be understood, thet when Ulyeeee appears to
acquiesce in the advice o( the prophet, he hee no intention of demeening himself eo fer ee
to followitz “n ee mirem-es laeoneultetion eene repondre antesin, et eene decla-er
le perti ὲ quoi il ee determine ” (Senndon). Ae it would be difficult ιο avoid condemning
the whole construction of the Setire except by understanding it to be nn exmvegunt
burleeque, we need not be et the trouble of determining what the intentione of ulysse·
were when the impu-iona Proserpine abruptly summoned his oouneellor end broke off the
dialogue.

The mention of the Parthiam (v. ⁶2) once more niues up among the chronologiae
the ghoet of Crassus end the manda recovered in Anno. 734. The Freneh editore
take it for ςηιιιοᾱ the Setis-e was written ester thet event. Frenke more probably placen
the date before the battle of Actium, though he thould have remembered C. i. 2. 41,

‘⁸ Sive mutate juvenem figure
Alea in terrie iminfis,’'

where, by ‘ juvenem,’ Augustus ie clearly meent (nee note), before he come ιο the eon-
elueion thet efter the battle of. Actium ⁴⁸ poete unicum rerum arbitrum vix juvenis nomine
insignivieeet.” The above ode που written not earlier then mmc- 725.
