CARMEN V.

Am. c· 728.

There would seem to have been generally prevalent a feeling of soreneas and impatience
under the disgrace, eo long unredeemed, of the reverse! anatained in Asia by the Roman
arma under craesus and M. Antonius· and this feeling it appears to be Horace' a purpose
inthia ode to allay, and to diacourageany hope or desire fcrtheretnrnof theParthian
prisoner-a. This desire Horace seems to impete to a degener-ate spirit, and the story of
Regulus ns introduced apparently to call back men ’a minda to the standard of a former
generatiou. An honor-able death, he tella them, is better than a dishonorable elavery, and
a vix-tuone fame ia more to be cared for than personal sasety.

The usual inam-iptions, ‘⁶ In laudem Caesaris Augusti,” “ Ad divum Aug-ustum,” διο..
do not reprecent the purport of the ode, though it is introduced with a flattering prophecy
of the emperor-’a success in the expedition he had probably just entered upon, which was
that noticed in the la‘st ode.

the Mede? ''l'waa not thus Regulias acted, when he saw the min a coward'a example
would bring on those who should come aster him3 and he aiod, ‘⁸ 1 have acen our
atandards hung on Punic walls, om· freemen bound ; their gates nnbat-red ς their fielda
all tilled. Will the ransomed soldier come back more ready for the fight ? Ye do but
add ruin to ahane: the dyed wool recoveru not ita fair colom-3 and so virtue once lost
