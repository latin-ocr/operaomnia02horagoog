EPISTOLARUM ΙΙ. 1.

669

Militiae quamquam piger et malus, utilis urbi,

Si das hoc parvis quoque rebus magna juvari.
Os tenerum pueri balbumque poeta figurat,

12⁵

Torquet ab obscoenis jam nunc sermonibus aurem,
Mox etiam pectus praeceptis format amicis,
Asperitatis et invidiae corrector et irae 3

Recte facta refert, orientia tempora notis

130

Instruit exemplis, inopem solatur et aegrum.
Castis cum pueris ignara puella mariti

Disceret unde preces vatem ni Musa dedisset?
Poscit opem chorus et praesentia numina sentit,

Caelestes implorat aquas docta prece blandus,

13⁵

Avertit morboS, metuenda pericula pellit,

Impetrat et pacem et locupletem frugibus annum.
Carmine di superi placantur, carmine Manes· ’
Agricolae prisci, fortes parvoque beati,

Condita post frumenta levantes tempore festo

140

Corpus et ipsum animum spe finis dura ferentem,
Cum sociis operum, pueris et conjuge fida,
Tellurem porco, Silvanum lacte piabant,

127. jam nuuc] See C. iii. 6. 23, n.
As to ‘sermm' see C. iii. 24. 543 S. i. ⁴.
121. A. P. 3⁰7, and other places. For
‘ corrector,' see Epp. i. 15. 37. ‘Orientis
tempora ’ seems ω mean the time of youth,
as we say, the dawn of life. Orelli says it
does not mean this, but each season of
life as it begins.

132. Castis cum pueris] Tine Carmen
saeculare was sung by a cheir, consisting
of twenty-seven bo s, and as many girls, of
noble birth (see ntroduction); and such
choruses were usual on special occasions of
that sort. The vestal virgins addressed
their prayers to their goddess ‘ docta prece,'
the equivalent for which is ⁶ carmine ι’

“ --- prece qua fatigent
'Virgines sanctae minus audientem
Carmina Vestam ?'’ (C. i. 2. 26)

where ⁶ prece ' is opposed to ‘ carmina,'
though the latter too were prayers, and per·
hapa in verse, but in a set form, ⁴ doctae
precem'

138. carmine Manem] The great an-
nual festival at which the Manes, the souls
of the departed, were worshipped, was the
Lemuria, which was celebrated in May, on
the eth, llth, and lath days of the month.

They were also worshipped shortly aster a
funeral at the ⁸ seriae denicales,’ when the ,
family of the deceased went through a puri-
fication. Τὶιο Lares being also the spirits
of the dead, differed only in name from the
Manes, which were ordinarily inserted in
sepulchral inscriptions, as the Dii Manes of
the departed. The name is derived from a.
root signifying ⁴ good,’ (or none but the good
could become Manes. But Augustino (de
civ. Dei, ix. 11) quotes the authority of
Plotinus (for whom it appears he should
have said Apuleius de Socratis Daemone)
for saying “ animas hominum daemonas
esse, et ex hominibus fieri Lares si boni
meriti sunt3 Lemures si mali seu Larvas3
Manes autem deos dici si incertum est
bonorum eos seu malorum esse meritorum.”
This the name itself disproves. Their
existence was a matter of some scepticism,
as observed on C. i.·4. 16. Here the name
seems to embrace all the infernal deities,
as Dis, Proserpina, Tellus, the Furiae, dcc.
143. Tellurem ρον-σω] The temple of
Tellus in the Carinae has been mentioned
before, Epp. i. 7. 48, ιι. She was wor-
shipped among the ⁴ dii inferi ' οι· Manes.
Her annual festival, the Fordicidia, was
celebrated on the l5th of April. ⁴ Forda ³
