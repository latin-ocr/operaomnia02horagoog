HORATII FLAOGI

Spectat Roma potens ς habet hos numeratque poetas
Ad nostrum tempus Livi scriptoris ab aevo.
Interdum vulgus rectum videt, est ubi peccat.

Si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas

Ut nihil anteferat nihil illis comparet, errat:

65

Si quaedam nimis antique, si pleraque dure
Dicere credit eos, ignave multa fatetur,

Et sapit et mecum facit et Jove judicat aequo.
N on equidem insector delendaque carmina Livi

Esse reor, memini quae plagosum mihi parvo

brated poets were performed at first either
on scaffoldings erected in the Circus aud
afterwards taken down, or in temporat-y
wooden theatres, usually on a very large
scale; the notion being that a systematic
encouragement of plays by the erection of
permanent buildings was injurious to pub-
lic morals. The first permanent stoue
thaan-e at Rome (for they had them in the
country towns some time before) was built
by Cn. Pompeius aster the Mithridatio war
outside the walls, near the Campus Mar-
tius, on the spot, as is supposed, now called
Campo di Fiore (Cramer). It held «10,ωο
people. There are no remains οἳ it.
Augustus erected another near the Pons
Fabricius, just outside the walls, to the
memory of his nephew Marcellus (of which
some remains are still visible), and by his
desire a third was built in the Campus
Martius by L. Cornelius Balbus. It is to
these three, the only thaan-es of the time,
that Ovid alludes (A. A.. iii. 394), ‘⁴ Visite
conspicuis terna theatra locis.” See also
Suetonius (vit. Aug. 4⁶), ‘⁴ Per hina theatra
virgis caesum relegaverit” (Stephanionem,
an actor). For the particulare of a Roman
thaan-e, see Dict. Ant.

62. Livi scriptoris ab aeva] T. Livim
Andronicus is spoken of by Quintilian as
the first Roman poet, and without much
respect:—“ Quid erat futurum si nemo
plus effedsset eo quem sequebatur? Nihil
iu poetis supra Livium Andronicum, nihil
in historiis supra Pontificum annales habe-
remus” (x. 2. 7). The date of his birth is
uncertain, but he flourished in the middle
of the third century n.c., and died A.u.c.
633, or thereabouts. His first play was
represented the year before Ennius was
born, A.u.c. 514, as Cicero says on the
authority of Ennius (Brutus, c. 18). He
also says this was the first play put upon
the stage (all before had been extempore
performanoes). He is said to have been

born at Tarentum, which Niebuhr (iv. Ξω)
says is “ probably for no other reason but
because he was confounded with Livius
Maestus, who maintained himself at Ἱὶωει-
tum ’' (Livy xxiv. 2ος xxvii. 3⁴). ‘⁴ Livius
Andronicus translated the Odyssey, which,
from its relation to Latium. had grater at·
tractions for the Romans than the Iliad ε
he did not however translate the whole of
the Odyssey, but made an abridgement of
it in the national Italian rhythm, and notin
a Greek metre. All that Livius wrote be-
sides his Odyssey are tragedies which, like
the Atellanae, were not performed in stand·
ing theatres, but on a kind of scaffolding
in the Circus ” (Niebuhr, 1. c.). It has
beenaffinned that he alsowrote comedia
(see his life in Dict- Biog.); and Livy (xxvii.
37) mentions a hymn composed by him.
He probably eomposed others. (Ι do not
know on what authority Niebuhr says the
Odyssey had greater atmefions sor the
Romans than the Iliad. Τὴο reason he
assigna is hardly sufficient.) ‘⁴ Livius An-
dronicus (Niebuhr adds) was the client of
one Livius.” It is generally supposed he
was a freedman, having been taken prisoner
at Tarentum (Cicero, l. c.). His dramas
were all, as far as we know, ‘palliatae,’ from
the Greek. Cicero says they were not
worth a second reading= ‘⁴ Nam et Odys-
sea Latina est sic tanquam opus aliquod
Daedali, et Livianae fabulae non satis dig-
ωθίὲυῒὶίὶῖαἰΐπὲυθεεῖωᾚο first represents
the harshness of the style, the second Ι
suppose the dulness of the matter. There
wasawantof life he meansaboutthis old
poetry3 unless any one prefers understand-
ing ‘ignave,’ ‘carelessly.’ Compare A. 1².
445. ‘ Jove aequo' is the opposite of ‘Jove
non probante ¹ (C. i. 2. 19).
