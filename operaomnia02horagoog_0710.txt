EPISTOLARUM II. 2.

Romae nutriri mihi contigit, atque doceri
Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.
Adjecere bonae paulo plus artis Athenae,
Scilicet ut vellem curvo dignoscere rectum,

Atque inter silvas Academi quaerere verum.

45

Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato,
Civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma
Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.
Unde simul primum me dimisere Philippi,

Decisis humilem pennis ,inopemque paterni

Et laris et fundi, paupertas impulit audax,

42. Iratus Graiis] See Epp. i. 2. 2, ιι.

43. Adfecere bonae] The knowledge
acquired at Athens, and which Cicero says
was valued not by the natives, but only
by foreigners, who were ‘⁶ capti quodam-
modo nomine urbis et auctoritate* (de
Orat. iii. 11), was not only philosophy in
all its branches, but Greek literature, with
which Horace became familiar, especially
with the lyric , whose works were
probably never taught iu the schools at
Rome. But he here only refers to his
dialectical studies, which he pursued in the
school of the Academy. The doctrines
taught in Horace's day were those of the
fiffli Academy as it is called, established by
Antiochus of Ascalon, whose teaching
Cicero attended and whom he praises very
highly (see his life in Dict. Biog.). The
different modifications of Plato's doctrine,
introduced by Arcesilas, Carneades, Philo,

- and Antiochus, who were heads of his

school at different periods, may be learnt
from Ritter’s Hist- Anc. Phil. The latest,
which Horace studied, was an eclectio form,
in which Stoic and Peripatetic doctrines
were incorporated with the Academic. The
head of the Aoedemy at this time was
Theomnestus, whose lectures Brutus at-
tended (Plut. Brut. c. 24). Aristus suc-
ceeded his brother Antiochus (¹ quid illa
vetus Academia atque eius haeres Aristus? ’
Cic. Brut. c. 97), and Horace may have been
at Athens while he was teachiug. But he
could not have been alive when Horace left3
for Brutus was his intimate friend (Plut.
Brut. c. 2), and would not have attended
Theomnastus if Aristus had been still
teaching. Academus was an Attic hero,
and there was a spot of ground about three
quaa-tera of a mile from the city, on the
banks of the Cephisus, which was dedicated
to him and planted with olives, and called
after his name, Academia. Here Plato

taught, and trem hence his school was
named.

44. curvo dim-eccere rectum] ⁶ Curvum'
is used here lllte ⁸ pravum ’ for ‘ falsehood!
Persius uses it ἰιι the same derived way
(iv. ll), ‘⁴ rectum discernis ubi inter Curva
subit vel cum fallit pede regula varo.”

48. non responsura lacertis] Not des-
tined to match the strength of Augustus.
(See S. ii. 7. 86, ιι.) Ῑιι the first engagement
at Philippi (am-c. 712), Brutus defeated
the forces of Augustus and got possession
of his camp, while M. Antonius οιι the
other hand defeated Cassius, who destroyed
himself. But twenty days afterwards a
second engagement went against Brutus,
and he likewise put an end to himself.
How Brutus attached to his cause the
young Romans studying at Athens, and the
battles and wandel-inge heled them through
are related by Plutarch in his life (c. 24,
sqq} Ee laris et sundi,] ⁶ Laris' is

forfeited because he was of the republican
party. Others in his neighbourhmd lost
theirs in consequence os the distribution of
lands to the soldiers (see S. ii. 2. Introduc-
tion). He says nothing of the scribe's
place, which Suetonius says he bought (with
what means does not appear), nor does he
mention how he got his pai-don and per·-
mission to return. to Rome. He only says
he was driven by poverty to write verses,
which therefore he first wrote for fame,
that is to bring himself into the notice of
those who were able to relieve his wauts, as
Maecenas did. It is im possible to tell what
he wrote at first. The language of the
text does not necessarily imply that he was
paid for what he wrote ς but though Horace
never appears in a mercenary character,
