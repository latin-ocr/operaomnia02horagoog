bsbly the two first syllables tre only o
different. form of ⁴ Jup-’ in ⁶ J uppiter‚’ and
from the seme root ns Ζεύς.

Neu-ly all the old editions put ι stop nster

11. Atlanteusquefim'e] Apparently imi-

tated from Bul-ip. (Hipp. 3), τερμόνων τ’

12. Valet ima cummi-v] lt is impossible
not to compare this with vin-ione familiar
posanges of the sacred Scriptures ς ee, ‘⁶ He
luth put down the mighty stom their neat
end enlted them of low degree '' (Luke i.
52). ‘⁴ Promotion oometh neither from the
eust nor from the went nor from the south.
But God is the Judge3 he putteth down
one end netteth up mothoe’' (Palm lxxv.
6, 7). The sentiment however is common.

Ausonius in his uara epigram mys of For·
tune, ‘⁸ Bt summa in imum vertit et vern
erigit.” Horaee's words were no doubt
&miliu- ιο these writers· Bentley would
read ⁴ insigne ' for ‘ insignem ’ ιο keep the
opposition uniform. cunninghmn with
more oonsisteney would have ‘ insignin,’
comptu-ing Via-g. Aen. vi. 33:

“ Bis peu-iae· cecidere munus. Quin proti-
nus omme
Perlege-ent oculis,”

and other placen of the seme kind. But
we may be eontented with ‘insignem ' (the
reading of nll the MSS). which hu more
poen-y in it than the neuter, and is more
exproesive of that which is meent, the vicis-
situdes of human life. Bentley supposes
Horace to have had in mind Hesiod’e Works
