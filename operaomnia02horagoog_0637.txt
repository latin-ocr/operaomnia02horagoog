EPISTLE XIII.

This letter professes to be written by Horace ιο one Vinius Asells, the bem-eros eut-in
volumes ot* his ιο Aug-ustus st Rome, Horace being probably et his own estate. He
writes ss if he had given his friend particular and anxious instructions when he stu-ted
nstohowhewestobeheve,nndssif thiswns tobe sent after him to overtnke himen
the roed, in order ιο impl-ess those instructions upon his memory. Ῑι is probable thet
some such jokes may have passed between Horace and his messenger when he started,
end thet he amused himself estaerwerds by putting them into the form of this Epistie,
which it is not unlikely he shewed Augustus3 but more 1 think is mede of it in this
respect thenit will beer, ss if it were written for the especial purpose of commending to
Augustus the modesty of the writer, end apologizing for the inti-usion, end so forth. 1
cannot see any such design. The person is assumed ιο be ignorent of the world, end
therefore lisble ιο make mistakes in the execution of his mission3 to intrude nt nn nn-
sessonsble tim03 in the eegerness of his affection for Horace ιο be too officiens3 to carry
the books awkwardly, so ss ιο draw attention, or to stop in the ιιι-θοις in order to ten
his curicus friends what importent business he was upon. The person addressed is
called Vinius, end the allusion in ν. 8 lesds ιο the inference that his cognomen was
Asellus, or Asine, or Asells. Asellus wss e cognomen of the Annia, claudia, end
Cornelis gentes. Asine also was of the Cornelia. Porphyrion cells the man V'mnius
Asellis, while the other Scholiasts eall him Caninius (which may be en error for Caius)
vinnius Fronto Asine. There was one T. Vinius Philopoemen proecribed by the stium·
virs for concealing his petronus, whose neme therefore was the same, end the Vin‘n
gens was in existence et this time. It hes been conjectured by Decies, end believed by
others, thet the person here addressed was one of the five tenants mentioned in the next
Epistle, v. 3. The conjecture may be taken for what it is worth. No one cen deny tint
he may heve been one of those persons. He was not, es Orelli says, e ⁸ tabellarius ' or
letter ceri-ier, es his name snfficiently shows, for e ⁴ tabellarius' was n slave, yet some
heve treated him as such.

What the volumes were thet Horace was sending ιο Augustus it is impossible to ει]
for certain, but 1 think it probable they contained the three first books of the odes, und,
if so, the Epistle was probably written in Amne. 730. Franke thinks so very decidedly,
but ell do not adopt that dete, end some suppose the Satires ιο be the ⁸ voluminn' re·
ferred to.
