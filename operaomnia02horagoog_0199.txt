The situation and title of the fountain, the name of which is used in this ode, is suffi-
ciently proved by a buu of Pope Pascal 11., A-D. 1103, first brought to notice by Capmartin
de Chaupy in his work on Horace's country-house (vol. iii. pp. 364. 538), and given more
fully by Fea. There was a monastery dedicated to the Virgin at Bantia (C. iii. 4. 15).
over which the buu appoints a certain abbot, and over “ omnia quae ad illud (coenobium)
pertinent—videliceteeclesiam S. salvatoris cum aliis ecclesiis dc castello Bandusit',—eecle-
siam S. Anastasiae aptid Acheruntiam cum ecclesiis ad eam pertinentibus ; ecclesiam
SS. Martyrum Gervasii et Protasii in Bandusiae-fonte apud Venusiam? De Chaupy
made a journey to the spot, which he was able satisfactorily to himself to recognize in a
town called Palazzo, about six miles from the site of Venusia. Acron says ‘that Ban-
dusia was the district in which Horace's farm was situated, and some commentators fol-
lowing this statement have identified the ‘ fons Bandusiae ’ with the small -river Digentia
(Heenza) in the Sabine hius. This De Chanpy sufficiently diupi-oves. Lambinus adopts
the Scholiast's statement aa well as his way of spelling the name ⁸ Blandusiae,' which the
above-named document suffidently pmves to be wrong, though mest editor- have

adopted it.
