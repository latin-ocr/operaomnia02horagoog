Nomen iambeiS, cum senos redderet ictus

Primus ad extremum similis sibi.

Non ita pridem,

Nobilibus trimetris apparet rame, et Enni

In scenam missos eum magno pondere versus

Aut operae celeris nimium curaque carentis
Aut ignoratae premit artis crimine turpi.
Non quivis videt immodulata poemata judex,
Et data Romanis venia est indigna poetis,

Idcircone vager scribamque licenter! an omnes

Visuros peccata putem mea, tutus et intra
Spem veniae cautus? Vitavi denique culpam,

Non laudem merui.

He was no great admirer of them himself.
The great weight he atu-ibutee to the verses
of Ennius arose from the gravity of the
measure, consisting, ns v. 260 does, chiefly
of spondeos. But the absence of the
⁴ iambus? in the opinion of Horace, convicts
