EPISTOLARUM II. 1. 675

Spectaret populum ludis attentius ipsis,
Ut sibi praebentem mimo spectacula plura ;
Scriptores autem narrare putaret asello

Evaluere sonum referunt quem nostra theatra?

Garganum mugire putes nemus aut mare Tuscum,

Tanto cum strepitu ludi spectantur et artes

Divitiaeque peregrinae, quibus oblitus actor

Cum stetit in scena concurrit dextera laevae. 205

Dixit adhuc aliquid? Nil sane.

Quid placet ergo?
