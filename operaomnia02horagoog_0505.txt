HORATII FLAGCI

Permixtas capiet commotus habebitur, atque

Stultitiane erret nihilum distabit an ira.

Ajax immeritos cum occidit desipit agnos:

Cum prudens scelus ob titulos admittis inanes,

Stas animo et purum est vitio tibi, cum tumidum est, cori
Si quis lectica nitidam gestare amet agnam,

Huic vestem, ut gnatae, paret ancillae, paret summ,

215

Rufam aut Pusillam appellet fortique marito
Destinet uxorem3 interdicto huic omne adimat jus
Praetor et ad sanos abeat tutela propinquos,
Quid? si quis gnatam pro muta devovet agna

Integer est animi? Ne dixeris. Ergo ubi prava

Stultitia hic summa est insania; qui sceleratae,
Et furiosus erit ; quem cepit vitrea fama,
Hunc circumtonuit gaudens Bellona cruentis,

211. cum occidit decipit aqueas] This
is s clumsy collocation of words; but it is
not mended by the commas by which 4 ‹le-
sipit ’ is usually preceded end followed.

212. Cum prudens] Here Bentley has
substituted 4 ιιι ’ for 4 cum,' which he intro-
duces before 4 admittis! But the MSS. sre
unanimous in favour os 4 cum,’ end the
pronoun is not wanted. (See below, v.
234, ιι.) For ‘admittis' some MSS. have
:committisl which was Porphyrion’s reed-
mg.

214. δί· quis lectica] The 4 Ιοοιίοιι’ of
the Romans sud φορεῖον of the Greeks
were introduced from Asis, end differed
very slightly from the 4 pslsnkeens ’ in which
from time immemoriel the Asistics have
been carried. For full rticulsrs the render
may consult Becker Gall„ 4 Exc. on the
Carrisges’) and Dict. Ant. The principsl
points ere mentioned in Mr. Long's note
on Cicero, in Verr. ii. 5. 11: 44 lectica octo-
phoro ferebatur-‚⁹

216. Rufum aut Pusillam] These names
commonly occur in inscriptions, es Bentley
has shown by quoting several. Other
names have been substituted, snd he hss
rosinam for Pusillam.

217. interdicto lau-’c omne adimat jm]
The lsw of the XII tables assigned the
charge of persons who were ‘fiiriosi’ to
their relations in the male line, 4 egnati)
sud the praetor in later times chose the
person who should act ss ‘'cui-ator to the
insane person. The same lsw app plied to

‘prodigiss notorious spendtln-ifts. (See
article‘ Curator' in Diet. Ant„ end below

Epp. i. 1, 102, sq.). The story of Sophocles

brought before nn Athenian jury by his
sons, and reading the celebrated chorus in
his Oedipus Coloneus, to prove his senity,
is told by Cicero· ιιι his trestise on OldAge,
c. 7. ‘Omne Jus' menne every legal right.

221. laic summa est insania5]‘1nsnnis'
significo unsoundness of mind generally,
‘furor' the sume, accompsnied with vio-
lence. Horace's climax of madmen is the
fool, the msn of crime, and the ambitione
the worst of eil.

222. vitrea]‘ ‘Aut fragilis sut splendids⁸⁸
(Por-ph. ). It probably menne the latter, the
g litter of femep See c.i 17. 20, where the
epithet is applied to Circe, but probably
only ae it is applied ιο ‘ponto,' in C. iv. 2.
3, 111 the sense of‘ μοι-11133 ss ὑάλινος is
used ιιι Greek.

223. Hunc circumtonuit] This verse,
which has a. grand Epic tone, Orelli thinks
may be taken from Ennius. But Horace
may heve written it himself. He resorts
occasionslly to travectio to heighten the
force of his satire. The worst stage of

according to Silius' description of the battle
of the Trasimenus (v. 220, sqq)
