v. Nee Martiales Haediliae luposff] Hae-
diliae’ is the reading of nearly every Ms„
andin the margin of B, Orelli say-⁸, is writ-
ten‘ mons, ’and so he and Dillenbr. un-
derstand it—one of the Sabine hius. ‘Hae-
dilia,' the reading of some MSS„ and
most of the old editions, is only a cor-
ruption of the other. Bentley takes to
himself the credit of suggesting ⁴ haeduleae'
formed from ‘ haedus,' as ‘ equuleae,' ⁴ hin-
nuleae,' from ⁴ equus ⁹ and ⁴ hinnus.' But
Aratus aud Torrentius had anticipated his
conjecture, though they thought only of the
masculine ⁴ haedulei) ¹ Haeduleae' has been
very generally adopted since Bentley.
Gesner says this reading ⁶ haeduleae ' occurs
⁴ in bonis libris :' but he does not men·
tion which they are, and Bentley had never
seen them, or he would have mentioned
that he haddone so. ‘ Haediliae ' Lambinus
and some others prefer, as signifying ‘ the
folds,’ but no such word is found elsewhere,
and there is no analogy to support it. If

there were such a word, its antepenultimam ‘⁶

syllable would be long, as ⁸ ovile!

14. Hic tibi copia] The order of the
words is ⁶ hic copia opulenta ruris honorum
manabit ad plenum tibi benigno cornu!

The‘ cornu copia,' so common ln ancient .
works of art, was a symbol belonging to the
goddess Fortuna, to whom it is said to
have been presented by Hercules. More
may be learnt by referring to the Articles
Amalthea (whose horn it is supposed origi-
nally to have been) and Achelous, from
whom Hercules von it, in Smith’ s Dict.

18. fide Te‘ia]‘ ‘,''Perhaps says Torren-
tius,‘ ‘Anacreon had a song upon the sub-
ject, for to talk of adapting the Odyssey of
Homer to the lyre of Anacreon is absurdl'
That Horace had some reason for choosing
this subject is certain, but who shall say
what it was. ² Why Circeis called‘ vitreo.y
has been much disputed. Smart and Fran-
cis translate the word‘ fraill Dacier refers it
to her complexion, ⁴⁸ qui etoit uni comme
une glace.” It probably means, as Turne-
bus says, no more than ‘caerula’ in Epod.
xiii. 16: “nec mater domum caerula te
revehet;” and ‘ virides' in Ov. Tr. i. 2. 59 :
Pro superi viridesque Dei quibus aequora
curae.

mother Semele, who was also named

in S. i. 3. 31, ‘⁴ Male laxus calceus.'' Cyrus
