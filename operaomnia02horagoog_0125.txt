l. tempus in ultimum] Durin‘g the two
years between his leaving Rome and the
battle of Philippi, Brutus went through
many hard-fought battles with the native
tribes in Macedonia snd in Asia Minor, as
well as in resisting the assumption of his pro-
vince by C. Antonius the triumvir’s brother,
to whom the Senate had assigned it. ⁴ Tem-
pus in ultimum' does not mean so much to
the brink of the grave, as we should say, as
into extreme danger or need. Forcell.
gives examples of this meaning οἱ· tempus!

3. redonavit Quiritem] This word‘ redo-
nare' is peculiar to Horace. He uses it
again C. iii. ,33. It has been suggested
that Horace got Maecenas to intercede sor
Pompeius'pardon,1 do not know on what
grounds. ‘ Quiritem’ has particular force
as ⁴ unshorn of your citizenship! He had
not been capite deminutus. The singular
⁶ Quiris’ does not occur in prose-writers.
Heinsius’ conjecture ‘ Quiritum’ is weak
and insipid.

6. prime sodalium] It is probable that
the days Horace enjoyed so much with his
friend were spent at Athens. The language
does not seem ιο suit a mmp life, especially
on such a service as the army of Brutus
went through. On ‘ fregi' see C. i. l. 20,
note.

8. Malobathro] Oil produced from an
Esstern shrub of that name. Graevius says
it came from the Malabar coast, and that
its native name was Tamalobatra. It must
in that case have been of the betel tribe.
But the betel bas no amen, nor is any oil

extracted from it. If this be an Indian
plant, ⁴ Syrio’ is only used in the same ex-
tended application in which Ovid uses ¹ As-
“ Maeonis Assy-

syrium’ (Amor. ii. 5. 40) ι · see C .. u
. u. .

rium foemina tinxit ebur.”

9. Philippos et celerem suyam] We
need not take Horace too much at his
word. He was not born for a soldier any
more than his friend Iccius (C. i. 29) ; and
he could afford to create a laugh against
himself as a ῥίψασπις. He had in mind
no doubt the missortune that befel Alcaeus,
as related by Herodotus (v. 95). There
was nothing disgracefiil in the ssight from
Philippi, which Brutus advised and neoes·
sity compelled. Orelli interprete thus :—
⁴⁸ the boldest amongst us bowed their heads
to the ground which their shame had dis-
graced, to ask for quarter‚” as Caesar de·
scribes Pompey’s soldiers doing after the
battle of Pharsalia (Bell. civil. iii. 98).
Lambinus under-stands Horace to mean
that they bit the dust, as Turnus says of
Mezentius (Aen. xi. 418). “Procubuit
moriens et humum semel ore momordit,”
and Ag. in his prayer against Hector (ll. ii.
417): πολέες δ’ ἀ μ“φ αὐτ-δυ’ εταῖροι Πρη-
virs ἐν κονίῃσιν ὀδὰξ λαζοίατο γαῖαν, and
Euripides of Eteocles and Poly nicee (Phoe-
niss. v. 1438): 'raim 1⁹6 ὀδὰξ ἑλόντες α’λλὴ-
λων πέλας nim-ovem ἄμφω. All that
seems to be meant is that the bold were
struck to the ground.

13. Mercurius celer Denso — sustulit
aere,·] Poets were ‘Mercuriales viri' (C.
