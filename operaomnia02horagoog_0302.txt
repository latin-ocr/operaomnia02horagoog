sense does not require them. The con-
nexion isclear enough. Statius hasimitated
Horace (silv. v. 1. 122) :—

⁴⁴ -— velut Appula conjnx
Agricolae parci, vel sole infecta Sabino,
Quae ‘videt emeriti jam prospectantibus
Tem edeoee viri, propere mensasque
ΙωΞηιἛὲἔερωιαιφιο sonum redeuntis ara·

Horace may have remembered the passage
in Eurip. Elec. 71, sqq. On the meaning
of ‘sub ' with the accusative case, which
⁴⁴ in phrases of time significa immediately
..Μεθ’ (see Key'e Lat. Gr. 1374. e.).
Profoeeor Key muslates ⁴⁴ Sub adventum
regis” (Livy) “upon the approach of the
king, as soon as it was ennounoed.” ⁴ Sub
adventum viri ⁹ is not in anticipation of her
husband’s arriva13 but es soon ae he hae
made his appearance. weery with his day’e
work, she pute wood on the fire and gete
up a cheerful blaze.

47. horna— dolio] Poor wine of that
year, which had not been bottled for keep-
ing, but was drunk direct from the dolium.
Like the other pate of this description,
this ie meent to convey the notion of primi-
tive simplicity. The wine of the year is
generally drunk now in and about Rome.

49. inemptas] Georg. iv. 132 :—

⁴ seraque revertens
Nocte domum dapibus mensas onerabat
inemptie.''
Martial mentions the oysters from the
Lucrine lake (xiii. 82) :—
⁴⁴ Ebria Baiano veni modo concha Lucrino:
Nobile nunc sitio luxuriosa garum.”

And Juvenal (Sat. iv. 140) says of his Epi-
cure, that he could distinguish et the first
taete whether hie oyetere were brought from
Circei, from the Lucrino, or the British

a ‘port on the coast of Kent, now called

51. intonata] This participle occurs
no where else in extant writer-33 but it is
not likely Horace invented it. It repre-
sents the noiee of the wind rather than of
the clouds, as Virgil (Georg. i. 371) says,
⁴⁴ Eurique Zephyrique tonat domus. ”
Duentzer rendere it as a passive participle.
‘ sent thundering ς’ but itis more likely an
old deponent form. The ⁴ αωοβ what-
ever that fish may be, is said by Pliny ιο
have abounded most in the Carpathium eea.
The stom therefore must come from the
east that should drive it ιο the coast of
Italy. What bird is meant by ⁴ Afra avis '
we cannot tell, nor does Varro help us by
eaying thet the Greeks called them μελεα-
γρίδας, since it is uncertain what those
birds were. Columella (viii. 2) distinguishee
them, eeying the Romen bird hed e red
creet, the Greek e blue. The African
pheesant is e bird of remarkably beautiful
plumage end very rare, but 1 believe that it
is only found at present on the southern
coast of Αἰτίοις and, whatever bird the
Romen writers refer ιο, it was lese remerked
for its beauty than its delicecy. Martini
(iii. 58. 15) speaks of ⁴⁴ Numidicae guttam&
⁴ speckled,’ which seems ιο be the same
bird, end answers to the ep ce of the
guinea-i'owl, which fowl also eor-responde
to Varro's description, ⁴⁴ Gallinae Africanae
eunt grandes, variae, gibberae ” (De R. R.. ⁶
iii. 9. 18). Juvenal mentions it as a deli-

my (sat. xi. 1⁴2, sq.) :—
