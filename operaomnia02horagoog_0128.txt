CARMEN IX.

Am. e, 729 (ἒ).

C. Vulgius Rufus was n poet of much merit, end appears to heve been sud for the loss
of n young slave (not his son, ns Sanadon and Dacia· suppose, arguing from the exemplet}
brotght forwsrd in mitigation of 'Valgius' grief). At a &ime of public rejoicing (probably
nt the closing of the temple of J anus, inu-c. 729, after the Cantabri hed been put down
by Aug-ntus, C. ii. 6. Introduction) Vdgius is called upon (as Tibullus was in C. i. 33)
to ωηο from writing mournful verses on his loss, end to turn his thoughts to the praises

of Augustus.
ARGUMENT.

The nin does not always full, nor the sturme rege, nor the frose eontinne for ever, Vdgius.
But thou mom-nest for Mystes from morning till night. Nestor did not always weep
for Antilochus, nor his parents and sistere for 'hoilus- Cease thy wnilings, end let us

sing of the triumphs of Augustus.

Non semper imbres nubibus hispidos
M auant in agros aut mare Caspium
Vexant inaequales procellae
Usque, nee Armeniis in orie,
