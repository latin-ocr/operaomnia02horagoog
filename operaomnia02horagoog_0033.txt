8 HORATII FLAGGI

than in connexion with those prodigies which seemed to speek the wrath of Hoeven
against civil discord. Other poete wrote of these prodigies which were very notorious.
See Tibull. ii. 5. 71, sqq.; Ovid, Met. xv. 782, sqq.; and one phenomenon poeticony
described by Horace is recorded by Dion. (xlv. 17)= rai ἰχθῦς ἐκ τῆς θαλάσ-
σης ἀμύθητοι κατὰ τὰς τοῦ Τιβέριδος ἐκβολὰς ἐς τὴν ἤπειρον ἐξέπεσον.

If this ode is read with C. ii. 15, and the others mentioned in the Introduction to thet
ode, the feeling with which Horace entered into the mission of Augustus as the reformor
will be better understood.

ARGUMENT.

Portenta enough heth Jove sent upon the earth, making it afraid lest a new deiuge
were coming, as the 'liber rolled back from its mouth threatening destruction to the
city, the unauthorized avenger of Ilia!

Our sons shall henr that citizens heve whetted for each other the steel that should have
smitten the enemy.

What god shall we invoke to help us? What prayers shall move Veste to pity? To
whom shall Jove assign the task of wiping out our guilt? Come thou, Apollo ς or thou,
smiling Venus, with mirth and love thy companions3 or thou, Mars, our founder, who
hast too long spon-ted with war3 or do thou, son of Maia, put on the form of a men
end let us cell thee the avenger of Caesa-3 nor let our sins drive thee too soon eway3
here take thy triumphu be thou our father and our prince, and suffer not the Mede to
go unpunished whilst thou art our chief, Ο Caesar.

dirae] It is very common in Horace
(though not peculier to him) to find an

and ‘⁴ fidem mutatosque Deos” (C. i. 5. 6) ;
‘⁴ poplitibus timidoque tergo” (C. iii. 2. 16),

i! This is not true in to some words,
which though they heve the force of adjec-
tives are in fect participles. For instance,
“Ab insolenti temperatam laetitia ’' (C.
ii. 3. 3). Bentley, therefore, attributes
too much perhaps to the authority of his
grammarian in adopting this as an invari-
able rule in respect to the participle. No

 

will observo for himself. Horace uses this
construction so frequently that it may be
looked upon as a feature in his style3 and
he osten uses it with effect.

2. rubente] Virgil has (G. i. 328) “ Co-
rusca dextera‚” where, however, it may be
doubted whether ‘ corusca ' belongs to ‘ ful-
mina ’ orto ¹ dextera.’ Some MSS. have ⁸ ru-
benti! But Bentley (on C. i. 25. 17) quotes
Verrius Flaccus, a grammarian of the Au·
gustan age, who lays down the rule that
in Horeoe all nouns ending in ‘ ns ’ have
the termination of the ablativo in ⁴ e,’ not

doubt Horace would have used the long
vowel if ever it had been convenient.

3. arces] The sacred buildings on the
Capitoline hill. They were called collect-
ively Capitolium or Arx (from their posi-
tion), Arx Capitolii, and sometimes by ’
hendiadys, ‘⁴ Arxet Capitolium.” (Livy, ν’.
39, διο.) They embraced the three tem-
ples of J up. Opt. Max„ Juno, and Minerva,
of Jupiter Feretrius, and of Terminus.
