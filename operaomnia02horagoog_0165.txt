1. amice] Some Mss„ which Lambinus
and Bentley follow, read ⁴ amici ς’ and the
ancient fitle ⁴ ad amicos ' shows that the
Gramma-iens who first affixed that title had
⁴ emici' before them. And Acron says,
‘⁴ Oden generaliter ad amicos scribit com-
monens,” &c. But Horace’s advice is ad-
dressed to the young, as he shows not only
in the introductory stam of the first ode,
but in the opening also of this. ‘Amice
ferre ' is plainly the reverse of ⁴ moleste
ferre,' end corresponds to ‘ clementer' in
Cicero’s letter to Atficus (vi. i.)= ⁸⁸ Gnaeus
noster clmenter id fert ” (the loss of his
money). ‘⁶ Ferendum est molliter sapienti ’⁹
is mother form of expression for the same
loni* ⁴ ιωίοοςῖἑοὶιοῖθιιῗὲῃοξὲιὶιῗ 1³⁸2oequ ἔξεο)
probably read ⁸ amici! 1 observe he chiefly
used Lambinus' Horace. ⁴ Militia,’ in the
next verse, may depend either on ⁴ robustus'
or ⁴ condiscat! Orelli decides on the letter,
1 do not know why.

3. Parthos fiir-oves] ‘⁴ Species pro ge-
nere ” (Acron).

5. cub divo et trepidis] Doering omits
‘et’ against all MSS. and editions, to the
{iffi ἓξ ἒξριέθῖεέεὲῗὲ, Ἥ» „213⁴ss ἶ αἶ’
vo,' as ⁸ que' couples ‘vitem εις-αι’ with
⁴ Parthos vexet.'

6. Illum ea· moenibus] This picture, re-
{ffiffizsshffifflff ¹h⁰0f⁸iss¹3313¹²032⁰ffi
lover, and tlle pmwoesffiefrthe Roman soldier,
hes been much commended. It is not in

Horace’s usual style, and is perhaps better

suited to an ode addressed to the young
than to any other. Το them it might be
inspiring, but hardlyto older minda. Helen,
looking out with her demsels from the walls
of 'IX-oy, 11. iii. 139, sqq.), οι· the description
of Hesi (Scut. Herc. 242),—

, --αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες ἐϋδμήτων ἐπὶ
,(άῖἴῖἔῖνόξὺ βόων sard δ’ ἐδρύπτοντο

παρείας,

or Antigone looking from the walls of
Thebes (Em-ip. Phoen. 88), were perhaps
before Horace s mind.

13. Dulce et decorum esi] In Horuoe's
mind there was n. close connexion between
the virtue of frngnl contentment and devo-
tion to one’s country. They ere associated
below (C. iv. 9. 49, sqq.).

1⁴. persequitur] In this word is contained
sll that Bentley would gain by chnnging it
against the MSS. to ⁴ oonseqmtur: and it is
more graphio. The line is a translation
from Simonides (65 Bergk),—

ὁ δ’ αὖ θάνατος εἶχε καὶ τὸν φυγῦμαχον.

Horace may have seen Tyrteeus' elegy (7
Bergk), which begins—-

rtovdpetvac γὰρ καλὸν ἐνὶ προμάχοισι

πεσονῗα

ἀνδρ’ ἀγαθὸν περὶ ᾖ πατρίδι μαρνάμενον,
‘ Persequi' signifies ⁴ to pur-sue end over·
take! Bentley prefers ⁸ ve' to ‘ que,' with
‘timido,' a change he osten makes. His
resson is odd‚-—that there was no need for
death to strike in more than one place: one
would be enough. ‘⁶ Quod sene argutius !”
