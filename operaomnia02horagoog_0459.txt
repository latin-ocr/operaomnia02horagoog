vius was we cannot tell. It has been sup-
posed that it was the person to whom the
poem Culex, attributed to Virgil, is sd·
dressed. Corum. Cruq. supposes Augustus
to be meent. But efter the death of the
dictstor Octavius became C. Julius Caesar
Octavianus, snd could not st this time be
called Octavius. On Fuscus (to whom the
epithet ‘optimus' belongs), see C. i. 22.

Cruq. says much the same, sud this is all
thst cun be ssid of them. If Viscus be

one or other or both of these brothers.

85. tuo cum ,ἰν-αἰνὴ] According to
Ean-6 this vus Gellius Poplicola, Messalls’s
brother by adoption. He was with Brutus
and Cassius in Asis Minor; but lest thern
before tho battle of Philippi. and joined Μ.
Antonius, sud commanded the right wing of
his army st Actium. (See Dion Cass.
xlvii. 24). If therefore this be the person
Horace nlludes to, his acquaintance with
him began in Brutus's camp. He was con-
sul in the year sim-c. 718. Orelli adheres
to his notion (see note ou v. 28) that
Messalla hsd s brother Q. Pedius Poplicola,
but he produces no evidence of the fact.

four sons, of whom two were killed in
Egypt while their father was in Syris· one
who was mede governor of Syris by M.
Antonius, soon nster the battle of Philippi
(st which he was present), snd who appears
to have died in thst province shortly efter

he went there; snd one who was s little
child (παιδίον paaepdv‚P1ut.Brut‚ c. 13)
when his mother Porcia married Brutus,
which could not have been earlier thui
A.u.c. 706, when the elder Bibulus died.
He wrote sn account of his stepfither's life,
which Plutarch msde use of. This is sup·
posed to be the persouHorsce alludente.
He must have been still quite young, which-
everdste of thosethstsreproposedis
adopted. ln the Dict. Biog. this per-sonis
confounded with his third brothoe, end is
ssid to have been‘ ‘quite-syouth” st the
time of his mother’ s marriage. Plutsrch’ s
words cannot be so understood.

In the notice of Servius Sulpicius Rufus,
the distinguished lswyer und friend of Cicer-0,
in the Dict. Biog„ it is said briefly that
he left a. son mmcd Servius. This son
is perhaps the person Horace refers to.
Cicero was very fond of him, to judge by his
letters to his father, in one ofwhich he says.
“ Cum tuo Servio jucundissimo conjunc-
tissime vivo, magnamque quum ex ingenio
ejus tum ex virtute et probitste volup-
tutem cspio” (sd Fam. n'ii. 27. See also
iv. 3 and 4, where Cicerospesksofhis
grest literar-y sttsinments, sud Phil. ix. 3. 4,
5, where his grief for his fsther’s death,
mmo. 711, is eernestly dwelt upon). He
must have been older thnn Horace, sud γε]
much older than Bibulus.

Furniuswssslsothesou oft friendsnd
correspondent ofcioero, snd was s favourite
with Augustus. The epithet ‘candidus'
applied to him by Horace shows that he
deserved esteem. Shortly ester the battle of
Actium he got Augustus to take his satha,
who hsd followed M. Antonius, into favour,
sud his gretimde on thst occasion is recorded
by Senecs, de Benef. ii. 25. His words
show st least that he was no menn cour-tia.

“Hsuc unam, Caesar, babeoinjurismtusm·
effecisti ut viverem et morerer ingratus!⁸
Comm- cruq. says of him,‘ ‘historiarum fide
et elegantis claruit.”
