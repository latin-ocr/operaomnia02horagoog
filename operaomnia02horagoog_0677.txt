Me, libertino natum patre et in tenui re,

HORATII FLAGOI EPISTULARUM Ι. 20.

Majores pennas nido extendisse loquer-ie,
Ut quantum generi demas virtutibus addas 3
Me primis Urbis belli placuisse domique;
Corporis exigui, praecanam, solibus aptum,

Irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem.

Forte meum si quis te percontabitur aevum,
Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembres
collegam Lepidum quo duxit Lollius anno.

23. Me primis Urbis] This he considers
no small praise, as he says Epp. i. 17. 35,
‘⁴ Principibus placuisse viris non ultima
laus est;” and S. ii. 1. 75, “tamen me
Cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitur usque
Invidia.” He does not mind at this time
referring to his old generals, Brutus and
Cassius. The description he gives of him·
aelf corresponds with thet we find in his
biographer. See aleo Epp. i. 4. 15. C. ii.
11. 15. ‘Solibus aptum' means thet he
liked warm westher. See ii. 3. lo, n.

28. Colleyam Lepidum] Horace was
born on the eth December A.u.c. 689, in
the year of the consulship of L. Manlius
Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta. He oom-
pleted his 44th year therefore in December
A.t1.c. 733. In that year M. Lollius (to
whom C. iv. 9 is addressed) was elected one
of the consuls, end the other consulship was
offered to Augustus, who was in Sicily on his
way to Samos for his health. Augustus re-
fusedit,andafteragreatdealofinh·igueand

disturbanee between Q. Aemilius Lepidus
and L. Silanus, who were summoned by Au-
gustus to answer to him for their conduct.
Lepidus was elected. Orelli thinks this
aster-election is referred to in the word
‘duxit‚' as if Lollius, being first in the
place, drew the other to him, which appar-s
to me rather far-fetched. Hor-aee is not
likely to heve spoken of him ss the author
of his mlleagne's electiori, whatever hand
he may have had in securing it. Why
Horace should be so ' in letting
the world know his present age in the abore
year 1 can t tell. He was in a eommuni-
cative moo when he wrote, and tells ns in
e few words s good deal about himself.
Porphyrion says, ‘⁴ Annos quatuor et qua-
draginta dicit, et simul ostendit et quo mense
natus et quo anno aetatis suae hunc per·
scripserit) 1 do not see that any such in-
tention can be ascertained from t-he text.
But Franks agrees with the Scholinst (ωε
Introduction).
