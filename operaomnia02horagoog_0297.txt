Pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascui&
Neque ut superni villa candens Tusculi
Circaea tangat moenia.. 30
Satis superque me benignitas tua
Ditavit: haud paravero
Quod aut avarus ut Chremes terra premam,
Discinctus aut perdam nepos.

egreeing with ‘juvencis’ ere bad. The
editors generally understand Horace to be
alluding to the rewurds of service in the
field. He uppeers rather to be impressing
on Maecenas thet he wishes to follow him
not for his bounty but his love.

27. parentia] Several MSS. have ‘pes-
cus,' which Torrentius prefers, though all
his MSS. heve ‘pascuis’ 1 do not see
much force in Bentley’s objection thet with
4 pascue ’ we should have three lines all
ending elike, 4 nitantur men) ‘ mutet pes-
cue,’ 4 tanget moenis‚’ end 1 hsve some
difficulty in choosing. Ι heve followed the
later editors. ⁴ Mutet ’ is used in the mnn-

ex Apulis in Samnium satiatum, etqueed
publicanum profitentur ne ei inscriptum
pecus paverint lege censoris oemmittent,”
where ‘insmiptum ’ meens ‘unregistered,’
it being required thst the enttle put to grue
on the public lnnds should be registered
with u view to the peyment of the tex
(scripturn). See Cic. in Verr. Act. 11. l. ii.
c. 70, Long’s note. The plains of Calabris
were very hot q‘ non aestuosae grets Cele-
br‘ue erments‚’ C. i. 31. 5), and to these
the woody hills of Lucania foi-meda pleasant
conti-est in summer.

29. Neque ut] The older editions hsve
4 nec! 4 Νοι· thet I msy heve e. white
msrble ville nem· the wells thet Telegonus
built, the wells of musculum on the hill!
He seys he does not went e vills st Tuscu-
lum where there were many hendsome
houses besides thet of Lucullus. See Cic.
de Legg. iii. 13. The ancient Tusculum,
Fen says, wss built on the top of the hill of
which the modern town, cheti, is built
on the slope. Fen says he has sroq11ently
seen the ruins of the old town, which was
destroyed Am. 1181 in the civil wers. 4 Cir·
ceee' is explained by C. iii. 29. 8, ιι.

· Bentley conjectures 4 supini ⁹ for ‘ superni,'

referring ιο 44 Tibur supinum,” C. iii. 4. 23.
But there is no veristion whatever in the

Mss„ sud supposing thet whst Bentley says
were true, thet 4 superni ’ could only be used
relafively, we mey imagine thet the highes-
pert of the town (44 superius haculum? es
Gesner says) wss more egreeeble then the
lower. But the word is used absolutely, ts
msy be seen by various examples quoted by
Forcell. It is extraordinary thst the expls-
nstion of Lambinus should heve found
favour with so intelligent sn editor es Doe-
ring, 4 that the buildings on my farm should
be extended end reech to Tusculum, '
which was fifteen miles off. hmbinus says
he speaks in en hyperbole, ns he certainly
would if thet were his meaning. Many
editors heve adopted thet notion end the
Scholiest Porph ‘on gave it birth3 but his
words though o scure do not eonvey that
meaning, “ Circaea teng-et moenie: Tus-
culum intelligendum. Sensus est eutem ut
neque in Tusculo possideam villam quse
ibi aedificia hsbeet usque sd ipsein urbem.”
Others efter Acron (Turnebus, xii. 14) think
ofevilleandserm reachingfiomTus·
culum to Circaei in Latium, taking ‘ vius
Tusculi ’ together.

31. Satis superque] This expression
occurs again Epod. 17. 19. The sentiment
is repeated C. ii. 18. 12ς iii. 16. 38.

33. Chremes] The allusion is perhaps to
s character in some plsy of Menander’s.

34. perdam πωροι] This is e more agree-
sble reading then the common one 4 ιιι
nepos.’ It has the suthority of Orelli’s B,
but beyond this Ι find no authority for Dil-
lenbr.’s statement, 4 sic antiquissimi eodioes.'
4 Ut ’ is not omitted by any editor earlier
then Orelli, end the question is not raised
by sny earlier commentator thet 1 bsve seen.
The Scholiest Porphyrion hed ‘ ut ' in his
copy, and the oldest known MS„ the Blnn-
dinisn of Cruquius, must heve hed it, or he
would have notioed the omission. Nevor-
theless it is probeble thet Horace wrote
4 perdam nepos,’ and thet the second 4 ιιι ’
was inserted by copyists to correspoud to
