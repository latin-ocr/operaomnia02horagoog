times for this character, another word used
in the same sense was ‘heredipeuu' whether

gustus claimed ‘direct descent from Aeno-s.
Tacitus mentions a s delivered by
Nero· ιιι favourof the people of Ilium, which
was built not fier from the supposed site of

the audent city, in which “Romanum

fiacunde executus, ut Ilienses omni
publico munere solverentur” (Anu. ιιι. 58).
Suetonius, in his life of Claudium (c. 2⁶),
mentions the same act of grace, and the

of Nero, “pro Rhodiis et Iliensibus
Graece verba fecit ” (vit. Neron. c. 7).
The Romans attached much importunes to
the legend which derived their origin from
the Trojens. See C. ιιι. 3, Introduction.
