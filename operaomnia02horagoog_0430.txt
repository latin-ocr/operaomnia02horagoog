Admonuit fugio Campum lusumque trigonem.
Pransus non avide, quantum interpellet inani

Ventre diem durare, domesticus otior.

Quaestor avus, pater atque meus patruusque fuisset.

‘⁴ -—— cur olivum
Sanguine viperino

Cautius vitat, neque jam livida gestat armis
Brachia, saepe disco,” &c. (C. i. 8. 8. sqq.)
The parsimonions Natta, who robbed the
lamps to oil himself, was probably· a person
of good family, that being the cognomen
of the Pinaria gens, one of the oldest
patriciau familias in Rome.

125. Ast ubi mesenum] When the sun
began to get hot about noon, and Horace
was tired with his game, he went to the
public baths to bathe, which was usual alter
playing, and then took a light luncheon
(see above, S. 5. 25, n.), after which he
lounged at home till evening, when he went
out for his stroll perhaps, and came home
again to his supper, as he told us before.
In v. 126 there has been made a more
violent change in the text than any other
that the editors of Horace have ventui-ed

quius' commentator and Porphyrion. the
saune. It would have been better if they
had explained it of the noonday sun. But
Cruquius observes in his Commentary that
the oldest of his Blandinian MSS. had
“fugio Campum lusumque trigonam? but
with marks of a doubtful reading under-
neath, and the received words in the margin.
Bentley, seized with his usual avidity upon
this reading, ⁴⁴ Aut enim egregie fallor, aut
ea sola sincera lectio est, et Venusina lu-
cerna digua? With one exception it has
been received into the text by every subse-
qnent editor whose edition 1 have seen.
Dillenbr. rejects it, and calls the old read·
ing “unice vera lectio.” 1 cannot myself
see the grounds upon which the new read-
ing has been so unhesitatingly adopted. It·
the other be weak, as I think it is, and this
somewhat more to the purpose, that may
only prove it to be a more ingenious inter-
polation than the other, supposing both to
be invented by the copyists, which is not
nnlikely. F. V. Fritzsche (in Aristoph.
Thesm- p. 13), quoted by Wiistemann in

his edition of Heindorf's Notee, and by
Orelli in his excursus on this passage, says
that Mavortius, the editor from whom we
are said to have derived the received text of
Horace, found an hiatus after ‘fugio ⁹ in
his copies, and absurdly filled it up with
the words ‘ rabiosi tempora signi.' But
why the copyist of the Blandinian MS.
found no hiatus, and was guilty of no inter-
ffilation, the same scholar does not say. 1

ve followed the judgment of suc‘n scholare
as Gesner, Deering, Heindorf, Fea, Orelli,
in receiving the new reading, which is un-
doubtedly neater than the other, but without
much saith in the verse having been so
written by Horace. ⁴ Lusum trigonem'
was a game of ball only mentioned else-
where by Martial. The players, as the
name implica, were three in number, and
stood in a triangle. Their skill appears to
have been shown in throwing and catching
tho ball with the left hand ε4

“ Sic palmam tibi de trigone nudo
Unctae det favor arbiter coronae ς
'Nec laudet Polybi magis sinistras.”
(Mart. vii. 72.)

An unskilful player is represented as catch-
ἱιιιὶξ {gif} ball with the right hand as well as

“Captabit tepidum dextra laevaque trigonem
Imputet exceptas ut tibi ἓξὲξ puna-hg)

Dillenbr. doubts whether this game was
known in Horace’s day. It is no where
mentioned earlier than Martialg and Ι am
surprised that Becker, from whom (Gallus,
Exc. ⁶ on the Games ') the above account is
taken, does not refer to this passage of
Horace. From the above passage of
Martial, Bentley proposes to read ⁸ nudum,'
thereby (for the sake, as usual, of a mere
verbal correspondence between passages that
have no connexion) weakening the slender
authority on which his emendation rests.
