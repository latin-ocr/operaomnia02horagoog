Gur optas quod habes? Non nosti quid pater, inquit,

Nec soleas fecit, sutor tamen est sapiens. Qui?

127. crepidas —- soleas ] ⁸ Crepids’
(κρῆπις) was s low shoe or slipper tslten
from the Greeks sud worn in undress ι
⁴ soles' wss s plain ssndnl fastened over the
instep by 8 strsp, sud worn by men ss the
‘sandalium' wss worn by women. Gellius
(xiii. 21) makes the ⁴ mpids’ nnd ⁴ soles’
mentioni, which they evidently were not in
Horsoe’s day st least. “Omne ferme id
genus quibus plantarum coloes tantum in-
fimae teguntur, caetere prope nuds et tere·
tibus habenis vincte sunt, ‘solens’ dixerunt,
nonnunquam Groecs voce ‘crepidulss‚’—-
ejusque calceamenti sutores ⁴ crepida-ios ⁹
dixerunt.” The ⁴ soccus ⁹ was not materislly
different from the ⁴ oeepids,' snd the ⁴ Gal-
lice, ’ adopted from Gaul, wss like the
⁴ soles! None of these were wslking·shoes
(⁴ calcei ⁹) fit for wet or dirty rosds, but were
ordinm-ily worn only in the house.

129. Hermoqenes] It has been stated
in the Introduction to the second Setire
that this person hes been consounded with
Tigellius whose death is mentioned in that
satire, snd whose character is described st
the beginning of this. Hermogenes is slso
eniled Tigellius in S. 4. 73; 10. 80, 90. But
ss he is always spoken of ss alive. itis im-
possible he een be Cnessr's friend, Tigellius
the Sardinisn, to whom, ss obser-ved before,
there are no grounds for giving the nsme
Hermogenes, though the Scholiasts give it
him. Hermogenes Tigellius was a tescher
of music (S 10. 90), sud (whether ironicslly
or not it is not easy to say) Horace cells
him s first-rste singer here, and implies ss

much ιιι 8. 9.2s.13ut he hsd s. contempt
for him m other respects, ss sp ppesrs from
S. 4. 73· 10. 17 (where he eslls him s cox-
cornb), end 10. 79 (where he inu-eduee-
him with s fool for his friend or parasite).
He msy have hed some private pique against
him.

130. Alfem'us vasen] 1 have adopted
the orthography of this neme which Orelli

Acron ssys on this “Urbane estis
Alfenum vafrum (Vtrum ἓ) Cremonensem
deridet. qui abjectu sutrina quam in muni-
cipio suo exercuerat Romam venit3 magis-
troque usus Sulpicio jurisconsulto sd tuntum

changing ‘Alfenum vnfruin' to ‘Alfininm
Varum,' and giving Sulpicius the nstne of
Marcus. Estre (p. 187), sgreeing with
Weichert (Lect. Ven. pp. 46, sqq q.)‚ thinks
there 18 nothing improbsble' ιιι the Scholissts’
stntements. They appear to me to becom-
pounded of different elementr. one of which
18 the passage before us. The Stabulis-ste,
it is obvious, comsionslly give ss infor-
mstion that which they nppesr only to hsve
guthered from the text. Thst the disciple
of Sulpicius, who died mmo. 710, was not
the consul of A.u.c. 755, we may be pretty
sure. Ι heve little doubt the jurist, the
consul, sud Horuee’s ex-sntor (most pro·
bubly s different person from either of them),
heve sll been drngged in to make up the
story of the Scholinsts. It should be uid
however that the jurist is reported by Pom-
ponius to heve held the consulship. But no
consul of that name sppenrs till the above
Publius, who is with more probability sup·
posed to hove been the jurist's son then the
jurist himself. In Cruquius' oldest 131811-
dinisn MS. ‘ sutor' in v. 132 appeared ss n
corrected reading for ⁴ tonsor,' the original
word. Cruquius likes ⁴ tonsor’ better then

‘sutor,' sud quotes Alexander sb Alexandro
Genisl. Dier. lib. vi„ who says that Al-

hss compounded the two, only
