Supremo te sole domi, Torquate, manebo.

Vina bibes iterum Tauro diffusa palustres

Inter Minturnas Sinuessanumque Petrinum. 5
Si melius quid habes arcesse vel imperium fer.

J amdudum splendet focus et tibi munda supellex.

Mitte leves spes et certamina divitiarum

Et Moschi eausam: cras nato Caesare festus

4. Vina bibes iterum Tauro diffissa]
See Introduction, and C. iii. 8. 12, ιι. 3 and
as to ‘diffusa' ses C. iv. ὁ. 34, ιι.. and
S. ii. 2. 58. A smaller number of MSS.
than usual have ⁶ defusa' The two words
are commonly confounded, like all other
compounds of ⁶ di ' and ⁶ de.' As to Min-
turnae and Sinuessa see S. i. 5. 40, n.
Petrinus was a hill overhanging Sinuessa,
according to Comm. Cruq., or a *not of
land in its neighbourhood. The οισι-Βον-
ings of the Garigliano (Liris), on which
Minturnae stood, still render the surround·

tivatsd, yetnotahouse een beseen. The
labourers retire before night from the sx-
halations of the low grounds to towns built
on the skirts of the Apennines” (Forsyth' s
Italy, p. 263). These marshes are famous
for the adventure of Marius, who concealsd
himself ιιι them. The Fatorum ager and
Mons Massicus, with their celebrated vine-
yards, were in the neighbourhood of Sinu-
essa, and Martial speaks of Messio wine
made at that town (xiii. lin:

‘⁶ De Sinuessanis venerunt Massica prelis ι
Οοὲιτᾶιιὲὶςιιο quaeris consuls? Nullus

It does not appear that Horace’s wine was
of the best, and every body knows how two
viueyards close to one another may produce
winss of very different quality.

6. arcesse vel &inperium sen] “Fetch
it or else put yourself under my ‘impe-
rium,' asif he as master had the⁴ im·
perium' at his own table. Martini (xii.
⁴8. 16) has something like thisx

‘⁴ Convivas alios coenarum quaere magister,
thssecapiant mensae regna superba

For the full meaning of‘ imperium’ see
Dict. Ant. ‘’Aroesso is com pounded of

'(which is equivalent to ¹>‘otiati ') and
‘ossam ’which involves the same root(⁴ ci- ')
as ‘ciem' Many MSS. and editions read
’Ποσει-ιο which Wagner on Aen. v. 746,

saysis a form belonging to the age ‘ca-
dentis latinitatis! lt is more likely a cor-
ruption of the MSS. Fsa quotes in support
os ‘arcesso,’ from the calendar of Verrius
Flaccus, a grammarian of Horace’s fime,
found at Praeneste, mn. 1773: “Quod

ii. 43, ιι. As it was summer he does not
mean that the fire was lit, but that the

‘,'focus by which he means probably that
which stood ιιι the Atrium, near the' :mages
of the Lares, and which was pyrobabl of
bronze, had been burnished and rnacley gay
for the occasion. Differ-ent spedmens of
braziers have been found at Pompeii, all
moveable, and varying iu size and shape,
some of them combining a hot-water appa-
ratus with a charooal trough. ⁸ Supellex’-
