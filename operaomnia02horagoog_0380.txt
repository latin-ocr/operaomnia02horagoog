the composition of this Satire, aeye thatin
that year died Capito Ateius end labeo
Antistius, two rival lighte of their age. It,
then, he is the person Horace meone, it
could not have been sor his boldnesa of
speech towards Augustus that he cells him
mad, for he could at the outside have been
but a youth when this Setire was written.
Bither, therefore, nome other Labeo ie in-
tended, or some other mad steak of M. An-
tistius Labeo. From the way the name is
intmduced‚ one might suppose it was pro·
verbiel.1 cannot think with Weichert
(Lect. Ven. p. 33‚aq q.)‚ Orelli, Eae-6, and
others, that Marcus is probably called mad
because he beat hie servant violeutly on
some occasion for a small offence. What
Horace says is, that if a man were to do so,
he would he called by all eane men more
insane than Labeo, who must therefore
have had the reputation of being mad, per-
haps from hia reckloeenese or something oi*
thet sort. What aenae would there be in
aeying thetis a man beat hia servant melly
for a trifiing offence he would be held more
mad than Labeo, who did the same thing?
1 do not think the younger Labecia mengnt
atall, andifhie fatherhetheperson‚ there
must have been some reason which we do
ιιοι know that induced hie contemporaries
tocall himamadman. But it iejuet ns
puobable that nome one else of the same
name is intended, wherein 1 with

of the plebs about A. υ. c. 635. (Ιιὶν.Ε

ahow that it is not proheble M. Atinius
labeo should be thep man, end suggests

‘Labieno' for ⁴,'Labeone referring ιο one
of -that neme who for his virulence waa
called Rabienus by his contemporaries. He
is mentioned by Seneca in the preface ιο
the fifth book of his⁴ controversiae-⁹

friend has committed a fault ao small that

if you do not excuse it you must he looked
upon es harah· you hate him ιιι your bitter-
ness, and run away from him! ‘'Concedo
is used in this way by other writers (ece
Forcell. ). ⁶ Bentley would prefer-⁴ quoi ’for
⁴quod,’ referring ιο the next Satire,v.140,
‘cni si concedere nolis) But he ’does not
say why Horace should adopt the old form
here anyd the later. there.

Porphyrion, according ιο the text of As-
cenninz, calls the person⁴ ‘Octavius Drusus,
e usurer and writer of histodoe, ιο which
he obliged his debtors ιο listen, which
was the worst punishment they could
suffer-⁹⁹ Other variatione are ‘fRiso

&nquius first approved of ‘fRuso but
Bentley claime the merit of restoring that
name. Philostratus (Vit- Polemonis) men-
tions one Varus, who followed the same
calling aa Ruso, and made e stipulat-ion
with his debtors that they should, besides
paying interest, listen to his recitatione of
his own writings. Acron interprete ‘hie-

as the Evander of thie place, who ie clearly
the old king and ally of Aeneas. Porphyrion
professes to quote from certain writers who

charactoes· so that there must heve been a
good deal of attention paid ιο ιΙιιιι subject at
