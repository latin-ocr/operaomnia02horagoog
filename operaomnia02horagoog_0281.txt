HORATII FLAGGI

Te copias, te consilium et tuos

Praebente divos.

Nam tibi, quo die
Portus Alexandrea supplex

35

Et vacuam patefecit aulam,
Fortuna lustro prospera tertio
Belli secundos reddidit exitus,

Laudemque et optatum peractis

Imperiis decus arrogavit.

40

Te Cantaber non ante domabilis
Medusque et Indus, te profugus Scythes
Miratur, o tutela praesens
Italiae dominaeque Romae.

Te fontium qui celat origines

4⁵

Nilusque et Ister, te rapidus Tigris,
Te beluosus qui remotis
Obstrepit Oceanus BritanniS,

ὥστ’ ἀμητῆρες ἐναντίοι ἀλλήλοισιν Ὀγμον
ἐλαύνωσιν.

32. eine clade] See note cn v. 13.

33. te—-Praebente divom] See C. i. 7.
27, ιι. Augustus had the 4 auspidum,' and
his stepsons were his ‘ legati!

34. quc die] See C. i. 37, Introduction3
iv. 4, Introduction. It is not improbable
there may have been some representation
of Alexandrea Supplex in Horece’s dsy,
such ss the well-known figures of Judaee
Capta and J udaea Restituta on medals of
Vespasisn and Hadrian. We do not hear of
Augustus having caused such s medal to be
struck3 but, ss he had a triumph for the
capture of Alexandria, such a commemora-
tion of the event may very well have taken
plsce. On the reverse of a medal of Hadrian
Alexandria is represented ss a meti-on re·
cliniug with three ears of corn in her hsnd,
end the same number spi-inging out of her
foot3 while her left arm rests upon a cup
with s viue- branch springing out of it, and
a bunch of grepes hanging over its side.

40. Imperiis decus arrcyavt’tff] Claimed
for the vars carried on under thy impe-
rium the glory thou didst desire. ⁹ At-
tempts have been mede to fix other mesn-
ings on‘ arrogare ',here end in Epp. ii. 1.
35· but this ordinary sense of the word
suits both . What follows is s
compendium neview of the successes of
Aug ustus, sll of which have been noticed ιιι
these odes. Before the present ode was
written the Cantabri had been finally subdued
by Agrippe- the Parthians had restored the
standard dardsoi'cressussndu. Antonium the

Scythiam had sent to ask to be taken into
allianoe3 the distant nsfions of Asia had

of the tribes of the Danube (ii. 9. 23);

Egypt had long been a tributary province,

Parthian„ Britain, though only threat-
ened, had sent tokens of submissiora. Au·

gustus was just returned from Gaul and
Spain, where he hed put down the last
efforts of rebellium having also driven back
the German tribes, whose success against
Lollius hsdthrown s stein upon the arms
of Rome (see C. 2 ofthisbook, Introduction).

45. Tesmium qui celat oriyiaes] This
spplies only to Nilus. Ι sm not avane that
it was ever said of the Ister. The ancient
representatione of the Nile exhibit him ss
covering his hesd with his robe, or with the
wetere flowing from under his mbe3 while
the Ister is exhibited with his ιιι-ιι in a
medai of Trajan, on whom column he is
represented ss rising outofhis stream todo
homage to Rome.

47. beluosus] This word does not οοοιιι·
elsewhere in any classice} writer. It re-
duces to the form of an adjective 4 suten-
tembeluis’ (C. iii. 27. 20). It corresponds
to πολυθρόμ μων of Aeschylus, volverit-qe
of Thema-ituri⁸ aud Homer-'s μεγαεὴτης.
