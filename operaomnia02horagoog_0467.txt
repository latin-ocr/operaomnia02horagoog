47. eeu-vim iratur—urnam,] Comm.
Cruq. is the only one of the Scholiasts who
gives any account ot· this man. He says:
⁴⁸ Cervius Ascanii libertus calumniator ac-
cusavit Cu. Calvinum lege de Sicariis.''
EstrE, following Lambinus, thinks we should
read Servius, and that the person meant is
Servius Pola, whom Cicero mentions as a
low informer (ad Quintum Frat. ii. 13).
His friend Coelius, writing to Cicero (ad
Fam. viii. 12), mentions the same person as
oue whom his enemies were trying to enlist
to lay an informatiou against him. The
person he is said by the Scholiast to have
infor-med against is Cn. Domitius Calvinus,
consul A.u.c. 700. Another Cervius is
mentioned below (S. ii. 6), a totally dif-
ferent person. ⁶ Urnam ⁸ means the urn
into which the judices put their tablets,
or that into which their names were put
for drawing the jury, as the Scholiasta say.
Eitber way it is equivalent to ⁴ judicium!

⁴8. Canidia Aebuti, quibus] Acron
understands this to mean Canidia the
daughter of Albutius. Porphyrion says,
“ Ampbibolice posuit =” for it may be either
what Acron says or the poison of Albutiusx
‘⁶ hic enim Albutius veneno uxorem suam
dicitur peremisse.” Comm. Cruq. takes it
the first way, referring to Virgil's ‘⁸ Deiphobe
Glauci'’ (Aen.vi. 36). Dnentzer goes further,
and supposes Canidia to have been ⁴ amica
Albutii ς’ that he is identical with the Varus
ot* Epod. y.. and had his name, as she bers,
from his white hair, which is all mere in-
vention. Porphyrion's story may be as-
sumed to be the true one, or like the truth,
Albutius being a person notorious for having
poisoned somebody. We meet with another
Albutius below (S. 2. 67), whom Porphyrion
identifles with this person, and says he
poisoned his wife because he wanted to
many another woman. There are uo
grounds for contradicting this assertion,
and but little for believing it.

person we know nothing; but Porphyrion
says, “ Hic praetor filit apud quem accu-
satus est a Cicerone Verres Hortensio de-
fendente.” On that occasion Μ’. Acilius
Glabrio was praetor. Comm. Cruq„ in a
note of which the text is very corrupt,
calls him C. Marius Thurina, and says he was
⁸ J'udex corruptissimus,' that he presided at
Verres’ trial, and gave out tablets of diffe-
rent colours‚ that he might lmow which of
the judices voted according to his wishes,
-whicb is clearly all taken from a mis·
understanding of the words Cicero puts
into the mouth of Hortensius (Dicin.
c. 7). The words ⁴⁴ magnus ille defensor
et amicus ejus” (i. e. of Verres), by which
Cicero means Hortensius, the Scholiast ap-
plies to Turius. Asconius, on the above
chapter of Cicero, has a notewhich may have
led to the confused statements of the Scho-
liastsx “ Terentius Varro consobrinus frater
Hortensii reus ex Asia apud L. Furium prae-
torem primo de pecuniis repetundis, deinde
apud P. Lentulum Suram est accontus
absolutusque est a Q. Hortensio, qui cor-
ruptis judicibus hunc metum adjunxit ad
gratiam ut discoloribus ceris insignitas
judices tabellas acciperent,” δια, where
perhaps for Furium we should read Turium,
though Cruquius prefers changing Horacc’s
'surius into Furius, which the metra will
not allow. Doering, however, follows him.
As praetor, 'Parius could not be called
judex. The thrcat has reference most pro-
bably to a ⁸ causa privata,’ an action at law,
in which 'hirius might act as judex. (See
Dict. Ant.. art. ‘Judicium.’) ‘si quis se
judice certet’ is the reading oi* Lambinus
and the editions of the sixteenth century.
⁴ Si quid—certet’ is that of Ven. 1483 and
others of the earliest editions. The reading
of the text, Fea says, is in the Venetiau
edition of 1481. It is supported by the
best MS. authority, and Bentley has done
well to restore it to the text.
