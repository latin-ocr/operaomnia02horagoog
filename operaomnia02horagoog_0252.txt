CARMINUM IV. 4.

Venti paventem, mox in ovilia

Demisit hostem vividus impetus,

Nunc in reluctantes dracones
Egit amor dapis atque pugnae.
Qualemve laetis caprea pascuis
Intenta fulvae matris ab ubere

J am lacte depulsum leonem

Dente novo peritura vidit:
Videre Raetis bella sub Alpibus
Drusum gerentem Vindelici ;-—quibus

Mos unde deductus per omne

Tempus Amazonia securi

Dextrae obarmet quaerere distuli,

N ec scire fas est omnia 3—sed diu
Lateque victrices catervae
Consiliis juvenis revictae

Horacedoesnot require to be put on his
defence for such ιιι error, isit be so. ‘Pro-
pulitf ‘ docuere,⁹ ‘demisitss ‘egit‚⁹ are
used· ιιι ιιι corintio sense.

14. matris ab ubere] ⁶:Ab like ἀπό, is
used absolutely: fresh from the dugs of his
dam, yes Just weaned from the milk of his
mother! There* ιι no more tautology ιιι this
than may reasonably beullowed, and 1 see no
defect ιιι it. ‘11⁸th dep ulsum' and‘ ubere
depulsum⁹ ure both common phrases, of
which Bentley has given a sufficient num-
ber of instance„ but, thinking thst one of
these expressions is enough in this place,
he proposes to substitute out of his own

‘'maue or ⁴⁹·sponte for ‘,⁹lsete and,
though he will not contend that Horace
wrote either one or the other, he is satis-
sed that ‘sponte' is much better thsn

‘lhcte in which Ι am not avare that sny
editor hes been so imprudent ιι to agree
with him. Cunuinghsm has not proved the

proposes, which are ‘jam nocte? ‘jam Jam-
que’ (which Ssusdon and some others have
adopted, but which cun only have reference
to something immediately impending' ιιι the
future), and⁴ uberum Jam lacte! Others-
Gesner, Jahn, &c —have taken ⁴'ubere
for an adj ective‚ and 1 am surprized to
find Dillenbr. of this number, taking· Jam⁹
with ⁴,⁹ubere and interpreting thus: ‘driven
(by the strong instincte within him) from
his mother⁹s milk, though it be still abun-
dant: thet is, prematnrely wesuing itself
from its mother.

17. Raetis] The reading of sll but ι
very few MSS„ and those, 1 believe, os no
great weight, that of the Scholiasta, sud every
edition till Bentley's, is ⁴ Raeti⁹ (mbaefi’
or 4 Refi,⁹ but ‘Raeti' is the form which is
supported by inscriptions . The Scholiasts
take the two names to er, as it· the name
of the combined ple vus 4 Raeti Vinde-
lici.⁹ Other MS . heve 4 et Vindelici‚⁹ but
these are sll modern. Dilleubr. retains

Raeti⁴⁹ without inserting ⁴ et,⁹ sud supposes
ιιι snscolouthon to arise out of the digres-
affige—35) ‘notcrllgvii'g 3310} {heading-i:
os ιιι driginsl conjecture, and he sclmow-
ledges that Heinsius had hit upon the same
before him. But this is not worth dis-
putiug. The reading appears to me to be
the true one (see Introduction). Several
editors cust out the lines 18-22 ss totally
unmeaning, and Frsnke rejects them ss

lines into the text. They are quoted by
Servius on Aen. i. 244, and, whatever may
be thought of their besuty or aptitudo. they
must be looked upon as genuine. The Scho-
liasts, pretending to interpret the lines, only
infer from them that the Vindelici derived
their racc from the Amazone. Au we can
getherfrom these verses is, thst the Vindelici
carried some species of battle· axe, that the
Romans hsd felt the weight and edge of it,
snd that the Vindelici were counted ι strange
veild rsee whose origin and history the
Romans professed to know nothing about.
1 heve already drawn attention to the prone·
