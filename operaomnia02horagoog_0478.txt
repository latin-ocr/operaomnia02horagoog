Quid, tunc rhombos minus aequora alebant?

Tutus erat rhombus tutoque ciconia nido

Donec vos auctor docuit praetorius. Ergo

Si quis nunc mergos suaves edixerit assos,
Parebit pravi docilis Romana juventus.

Sordidus a tenni victu distabit, Ofella
J udice ς nam frustra vitium vitaveris illud

Si te alio pravum detorseris.

cui Oanis ex vero dictum cognomen adhaeret,
Quinquennes oleas est et silvestria corna,

Ac nisi mutatum parcit defundere vinum, et
Cujus odorem olei nequeas perferre, licebit

‘ O Publi, 0 gursoe Galloni, es homo
miser,' inquit,
⁴ Coenasti in vita nunquam bene quum
omnia in ista
⁸ Consumis squilla atque acipensere cum
decumano! '’
⁴ Acipenser ³ is said to be a stul-geon. 'rba
fish was ont of fashion in Pliny s days (N.
ξ. ix. 17). In respect to ‘praeconis,’ see
. i. 6. 86, n.
⁶0. auctor docum praetoriam] On this
Porphyrion tells us that one Rufus was the
first ιο bring into fashion the eating of
young etorks3 and when he was a candi-
date for the praetorship (which is a little
contradiction, since aster Horace he calls
him ⁸ praetorius,' but that does not much
matter, the story is equally good), being
rejectaelaexd, the following epigram was made
upon nn :—

⁸⁴ Ciconiarum Rufus iste conditor
Hic est duobus elegantior Plancis=
Suffragiornm puncta non tulit septem.
Ciconiarum populus ultus est mortem.”

who the Planci were we do not know, but
they must have stood for some office, and
were ⁸ eleganter emuncfi,' though Rufus
was ‘elegantins.' When he lived it is im·
εῗιιὲξᾶῗοοκιῖιὶ qrrhvdlgtlllg 'heaewzsellthzsfitrlig
⁶ ciconia,' in which case he deserved well of
those who liked good living. The stork
went out of fashion, as Ofella predicts3 and
though gulls did not take ita place, mnes
came into vogue, as Estre has pointed out
from Pliny (N. H. x. 23, ξ 30). See S. ii.
8. 87. As to ‘aneton' see C. i. 28. 14, n.
The word ‘ edixerit ’ is a play upon the

ι ‘edictum' of the ‘praetem'

55. pravum detorserim] Literally, ⁸ turn
yourself awry! Bentley, on the authority

of one MS„ reads ‘ pravus! 1 see no rea·
son for deserting the received reading, with
the vveight of authority that it has.

—- Avidium-vd The Scholiasta have
nothing to tell us of this miser. The MSS.
are divided between ‘ductum' and ⁴ dictum.’
In this, as in the last case, either would do.

⁶8. deffendere] ⁴ Diffundere,' which is
the reading of the old editions and many
others, as well as some of the best MSS„
signifies, as mentioned before, to draw from
the ‘dolium' into the ‘amphora,’ ‘metm'
or ⁸ cadus ' (all the same kind of vessel), in
which it was kept till it'was fit to drink.
When pom-ed from thence into the ⁴ crater'
to be mixed for drinking it was said to be
‘ defusum: and that is the only word that
has any meaning here. This miser’s wine
was of a poor kind, probably not fit to be
bottled in the first instance, but only to be
drank from the ⁸ dolium! He bottled it,
and did not produce it for consumption till
it was sour.

⁶9. licebit Ine repotia] On ‘ licebit,’
seeEpod. xv. 19. ‘Repetia' wasa‘coena’
sometimes given the day aster marriage by
the husband. I am not aware that any ex-
planation of the custom is to be met with.
The marriage-dinner was given by the hus·
band. A, that was usually a scene of
nothing but unrestrained merriment, per-
haps the religious ceremonies required pro-
perly to inaugurate the new life of the mar-
ried couple, and to propitiato the penates
and lares, were usually deferred to this
day3 and the sobriety of the ‘repotia’ was
probably designed to make amends lor the
lieense of the ‘coena nuptialis! The Ro-
mans observed their birthdays with much
religious accuracy, and with festivities equel
to our own. See note on C. iv. ll. 8. They
took care on every holiday to have their
