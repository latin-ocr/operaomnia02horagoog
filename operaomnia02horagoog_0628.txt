EPISTOLARUM Ι. 11. 603 ·

EPISTLE XI.

This Epistle is sddressed to one Bullatius, of whom we know nothing st all. He was '
hevelling in the Aegean end in Asis. Minor, sud was absent longer thsn Horeee wished,
or thought good for him, and the object of this letter is to induoe him to return. The
commentatore generally have s very menn opinion of Bullatium who hus suffered nt their
hands berder mensure then sny of Horsee’s friends. But his chief¹ vice seems to heve
been s. fondness sor mveuing, snd sn especiul admiration of some of the finest end most
nudent towns in the world. If we ure to edd to this that for some resson or other he
was unheppy, sud thought to relieve himself by change of soene, he may have been mis-
tuken in his means, but if so plenty of people heve shared in his mist-ake, end when
Horace puts before Bulletius ss the end of life the enjoyment of the present moment,—e.
doctrine he seems to hsve held pretty sla-ongly,·—we msy doubt whether his philosophy is
not at leuet ss bed ss his friend’s practice. But we need not assume any thing injurious
to Bullatius. Such reflectione upon mvol ss oecur in this Epistle might naturally hsve
suggested themselves whomsoever it hed been written to. We ure not to judge Horeee's
Epistles ss we would private letters, meent only for the reading of the persons they are
written to.

We heve no means of knowing when the Epistle was written.

ARGUMENT.

What think you, Bullatius, of the fine plsees of the Esst ἓ are they not all teum compared
with our Campus end Tiber? Have you set your hesi-t upon one of Attalus’ towns,
or are you so tired of trevelling thet you must settle down at Lebedus, the dullest of
places, us you know ἒ And yet 1 eould live there for e time, 1 confess, forgetting home
end every body, to look „out upon the stormy see. But the traveller who turns in to
his tavei-n to rest would not stay there for ever ς und he who wsrms himself by the fire
or s hot bath does not make these the end os his life. So if you have been tempest-
tost, and heve been glad to put into port, is that any resson why you should sell your
ship end never come buck? Those parts are very well for sick people‚ but ss long as
heulth snd fortune let you be at Rome, stay here sud praise Samos end the rest at s.
distance. Be thenkful for the blessings of the day, end live for the present hom-3 so
will you be happy whatever plsee you may be in. ’Tis resson that takes away sorrow,
and we only change om· clime when we shifl: our place. It is but s busy idleness that
employa us when we seek happiness in ships and in conches. All you went is here or
st dull [nubi-se, if your heert be true end fail you not.
