the year Am. 1811, on the eastern side of a
hill in the neigbourhood of the place now
called Isola Farnese, eleven miles north of
Rome, there were discovered by exoevation
the remains of this town, columns and indi-
catione of large buildings and temples, with
marble statues of Augustus, Tiberius, Ger-
manicus, and othere, and several public
and private insa-iptions, from which Fea
quotes “nvmcn‘na uvmcu’r. avovsrr.
nixu-ns. rmauunaml' From this it
maybeinferredthat the restorationof the
town was due to Augustus, and that it was
a ⁸ municipium!

170. qua populus adsita certis Limitibm]
⁴ Usque in this verse is an adverb of place,
not οι· time. It means ⁴ all the way up to
where the poplar stands! The Roman
term ¹ limitatio ' properly implied a religione
ceremony by which in earlier times the
:aaz &maxsumum
lande assigned in 'ty b the state to
private persons. e process y which this
⁶ limitatio ⁹ was affected is described by
Niebuhr very elaborately in the two appen-
dixes to the second volume of his Roman
History. ‘⁴ Every field which the republic
m„’⁰⁹“ked⁸*⁶{¹‚u{¹l'‚}“ sszzdffifflffiffffifffflsss
could take place without such a demarca·
fion3 and wherever there were any traoes
os the latter, although particular estates
within the region subjected to it might still
be part of the domain, it was yet a certain
proot' that such a separation had taken
place.” ‘⁴ The principle of the Roman
⁴ limitatio ' was to draw lines toward the
four quai-tere of the heavens el and
oeosewise, in order to effect a uniform divi·
sion of the lots ,of land which were trans-
ferred from the public domuin to private
property, and to fix immutable boundaries
for them. Hence these boundaries (¹11-
mites’) were marked by a slip of land lest
for the purpose nntouched by cultivation, as
balks orways,as theirextremitieswere by

a row of stones inscribed with numerals ''
(p. 624). Niebuhr conjectures “that a
fundus assigned by the state was considered
as one entire farm, as a whole the limite of
which could not be changed.'' But though
this should be true, and though each fundus
as a whole might bear the name of the first
grantee, ‘⁴ this did not preclude the division
of estates nor even the sale of duodecimal
parts of them3 but the original boundaries
circumscribed them as one in whole,
aud all the paru were pledged for the con-
ditione of the first aseignment.” ‘⁸ Hence
the termini comportionales '³ (p. 633).
These are such ⁴ termini ' or conventional
boundaries as Horace here refers to ε a
etone perhaps or an image of the god Ter-
minus, with a hee or a clump planted near
it. But there were many different kinds of
private boundaries. Cicero (pro Caedna,
c. 8) mentions a row of olivesz “ ejus fundi
extremam partem oleae directo ordine de·
finiunt.” ‘⁴ Fines autem multis modis
signabantur: terminis et arboribus notatis,
et fossis, et viis, et rivis, et vepribus, et saepe
normalibuS, et ut comperi aliquibus locis
inter arva marginibus tanquam pulvinis,
saepe etiam limitibus. Item petras notatas
uae in finibus sunt pro terminis habebitis”
quoted from Agger-ius Urbicus, a writer on
Roman land-surveying‚ by Torrentius, who
also refers to Varro, de Re Rust. i. 16:
‘⁴ Praeterea sine saeptis fines praedii sationis
notis arborum tutiores fiunt, ne familiae
rixentur cum vicinis ac limites ex litibus

cacumina, fagos.” The quotation from
Varro explains ⁸ vicina refugit jurgia‚’ where
Bentley, with little authority, reads ⁸ re-
figit? “cum non unam aliquam litem sed
plurative ⁴ jurgia’ dixerit,'' which is just
what the soi-istic nee of the perfect tense ex-
