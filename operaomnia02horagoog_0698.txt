Ut patris attenti, lenonis ut insidiosi ς

Exanimat lentus spectator, sedulus inflat:

Sic leve, sic parvum est, animum quod laudis avarum

Subruit aut reficit. Valeat res ludicra si me

Palma negata macrum, donata reducit opimum.
Saepe etiam au dacem fugat hoc terretque poetam,

173. Ωιιωέω sit Dossennus] Because
this person is not known from other quarters
it is oesumed by some that the name is not
that of a writer, but of a character in a play
of Plautus. This appears as a gloss in the
margin of one of Orelli's MSS. ε “ Dossen-
nus.- persona comica.'' Comm. Cruq„ on
the other hand, says he was a writer of
Atellano plays. There can be little doubt,
from the position of the name here, that it
represents a comic writer of the day. Pliny
(xiv. 13) mentions one Fabius Dossennus.
The verses Pliny quotes are supposed not
to have been his, but Plautus', and the man
himself Orelli thinks was a grammarian or
a jurisconsultus, not a poet. Seneca
(Epp. 89. 5) quotes the epitaph of one
Dossennus, which Estre and many others
22¹2& ffiffhfffflpffifflhss‘ffi' ¹¹12}ssss
no doubt Dossennus here is a comio poet.
Some MSS. and editions have Dorsennus.

Ant. Other shoes worn in comedy were
‘baxeae’and‘ crepidae,' for the same reason,
each being a loose sort of slipper, and the
latter not materially different, as observed
before, from the ‘ soccus! Horace means
that Dossennus is careless in the composi·
tion of his plays, which he expresses by his
running about the stage with loose slippers.

His only care, he says, is to make money.
The aediles, or any one who cared to put
a new play upon the stage, paid sor it.
According to Suetonius, Terence got 8⁰00
sesterces for his Eunuchus, which he says
wasalargersum than hadeverbeen given
for a comedy before.

of the Hecyra was interrupted in this way
(Prot 25, sqq.). At that time the plays

The beasts were hunted by dogs or fought
by men. But though the acting of plays
was in Horace’s time carried on in a theatm
(v. 60, n.) erected for this special purpose.
it appears the people insisted sometimes on
having a bear-buit or a boxing match there
to amuse them, in spite of the remon·
strances of the equites in the frent rows‚
who however, Horace says, were themselves
taken too much with processione and shows
that appealed more to the eye than to the

ear.
