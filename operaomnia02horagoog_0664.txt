Quem damnosa Venus, quem praeceps alea nudat,
Gloria quem supra vires et vestit et ungit,

Quem tenet argenti sitis importuna famesque,
Quem paupertatis pudor et fuga, dives amicus

. Saepe decem vitiis instructior odit et horret:

Aut si non odit regit, ac veluti pia mater
Plus quam se sapere et virtutibus esse priorem

Vult, et ait prope vera:

Stultitiam patiuntur opes; tibi parvula res est:

Arta decet sanum comitem toga3 desine mecum

Gertare.'' Eutrapelus cuicunque nocere volebat
Vestimenta dabat pretiosa: beatus enim jam
Cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes,
Dormiet in lucem, scorto postponet honestum

Officium, nummos alienos pascet, ad imum

Thrax erit aut olitoris aget mercede caballum.
Arcanum neque tu scrutaberis illius unquam,
Commissumque teges et vino tortus et ira;
Nec tua laudabis studia aut aliena reprendes,

Gratia sic fratrum geminorum Amphionis atque

names Numici and Minuci here and in the
above passage of Cicero. The great ma·
jority are in favour of Miuuci; and it is
enough ιο settle the question that the se-
· cond syllable in Numicius is long, as we
have seen in the sixth Epistle. There was
a Porta Minutia leading out of Rome, the
site of which is unknowng but it is probable
thatthis ruadledfrom that gnte, andthat
it was in the southern part of the city. 1
do ιιοι know upon what grounds Obbarius
affirms, with Orelli’s a pproval, that it is
certain this rond led through the country of
the Marsi and Samnites.

22. Gloria quem—vestit] SeeS. i.6. 23, ιι.

25. decem vitiis instructior] ⁴ Fur-
nished with ten times as many defecta!

26. veluti pia mater] Like a fond

30. Arta decet sanum comitem (oya, ·]
The siae and shape of the toga are referred
ιο on Epod. iv. 8.

31. Eutrapelus] Aristotle defines εὖτ’-ρα-
rthia as πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις, a refined
impertinence (Rhet. ii. 12). lt appears
thatforhis witthis namewas givento
P. Volumnius, an eques, and friend of

M, Antonius, ιο whom are addressed two
of Cicero's letters (vii. 32, 33). See his
life in the Diet. Βίας.. art. ⁴ Eutrapelus-⁹
From the way Horace writes he must have
been dead at this time.

34. honestum Officium‚] Orelli refers
ιο the last Epistle (v. 21), “ Officium facio,”
and explains ⁴ honestum officium ' by the
proper respect due from the poor ιο the
rich, the client ιο his patron, getting up
early ιο attend his levee, and so forth. 1
do not agree with him. 1 think it means
tlhe calls of duty, in a better sense. See

. ii. 2. 67.

¹3³6. Thrax erit] See S. ii. 6. 44. Ho-
race says he will get into debt, and be
reduced ιο hire himself as a gladiator. or
drive a eustermonges’s hack. ⁴ Ad imum '
is not elsewhere used as ‘ad extremum,'
but it means ⁴ when he has got ιο the lowest
point! As ιο ⁴ nummos alienosss see Epp-
ii. 2. 12, n.

peated in A. P. 436. ·
