63. Debemus· morti nos nostraque. -]
Horace probably remembered very well the
verses of Simonides (Fr. 123, Bergk).

χαίρει τις Θεόδωρος ἐπει θάνεν· ἄλλος ἐπ’
χαιριῗὲετιῷθανᾶτῳ πάντες ὀφειλόμεθα.

- receptus Terra Neptunus] The
‘heus Lucrinus’ was separated from the
hay of Baiae by a narrow musewsy, the
construction of which tradition attributed
to Hercules (44 Herculeo structe labore
viu,'' Ptop. iii. 18· , “Herculeum eom-
mendst iter-,⁹⁹ Silius xii. 118). Beyond the
Lucrinus lay the Avernus lacus (lngo
d’Averno), s basin without any outlet,
about a mile und a half in circumfer-enee,
und fed by masma from Mons Gaurus
(Monte Barbam). The space between the
two lakes was covered with wood.1n the
wer with Sextus Pompeius, Amne 7l7,
Augustus, advised by Agrip ps, to whom he
hed entrusted the tssk ofp reforming his
fleet, opened s communieution between the
lakes, und between lacus Avernus and the
ses, whereby he made s huz-bour in which
he wss able to prsetise his fleet. This he
called efter himself 4 portus Julius! 44 Por-
tum-1 ulium apud Baias immisso in Lucrinum
et Avernum lecum mari effecit. In quo
quum hieme tots copies exercuisset Pom-
poium inter Mylas et Naulochum supe-
ravit” (Suet. Aug. 16). This is the work
Virgil alludes to (Georg. ii. wll:

44 Andsmneslgam portus Lucrinoque addite

Atque indignatum magnis stridoribus
J ώζῖιῖιῗὶιοιιιο longe sonat unda refuso,
Tyssfflq? fretis immittitur aestus

The basin of the Luerine lake has been'
filled up by the rising of s voleenic hill
(Montep Nuovo), end is now s swsmp.
‘Regis opus '(like‘ regiae moles,' C. ii. 15.
1)“ is s work worthy of s king.

65. sterilisve din palus] The MSS. snd
editions very betweeu‘ que '‘snd ve! But
Horace does not mesn ιο couple s number
of illustratione together, but to take any
one of them: whichever of these great
works you plesse ιο take demuction surely
swaits it. How much more shall mere
words deesy. The shortening of the last
syllable is a ‘licentis sumpts pudenter-‚⁹ snd
not met with elsewhere. Quintilian (i. 7. 3)
r‘emurks on the quantity of this word.

“Palus eliud priore syllaba longa eliud se-
quenti significan et cum eedem litera nomi-
nativo cusu brevis ablativo longa est, utrum
affl? &2333 ἓῗοιῗέῧωῖἒὲἒὲᾞέ
that it shows thet later poets hed followed
Horsee's lieenee. Bentley snd others try
ω mend the passage ιο get rid of this irre-
gularity, but they had better have lest it as
it stsnds. What work Horace here alludes
to is very doubtful. Comm. Cruq. says ι

“Pomptinas paludes Augustus exsiccavit et
habitabiles reddidit, injecto aggere lapidum
uc terrsess’ Aaou say s the sume. “-Pom

tinam paludem sicoevit utsd mare mestum
flaba-e cogeret ut post et arari posset ''
Thst Julius Caesar eontemphted such s
work we learn from Suetonius (Caes. 44),
sud Plutarch (Cuee. 58. That Augustus
may have contemp it likewise, and
mede the esnal mentioned οιι S. i. 5. 7,
while that design was in his mind, is pos-
sible. The esnsl extended from Forum
Appii to Terracina, which is said to have
been the length of the marshes st thet time.
Hornee appears ιο be speculating upon a
work which, though often attempted, has
never suceeeded. ⁸For s history of these
attempts see Penny Cyclopeedis (art.
‘Pomtine marshes ’.)
