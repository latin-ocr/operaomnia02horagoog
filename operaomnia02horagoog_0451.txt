426 HOBATII FLACCI

may write trag-edm Varius bold opion Virgil bucolics3 my strength lies in that style
in which Varro and others have failed, though 1 am not equal to Lucilius who invented
it. 1 have no wish to rob him of the crown that is his due.

But I said the flow of his verse was that of a muddy stream, carrying with it more faults
than beautiee. well, do you never find a blot even in Homer, with all your learning?
Did not Lucilius find faults in Accius and in Ennius? Why may not I inquire whether
it was from the nature of his mind or of his subject that Lucilius wrote clumsy verses,
such as any one would write who thought more of quantity than quality, like Cassius
whose books were burnt on his own funeral pile? Grant him ull the wit and eloquenee
you please, yet if he hed lived till now he would have corrected much that he wrote, and
taken more pains than he did.

If you want to write well correct what you write, and look for the approval not of the
multitude but of the few. You are not ambitione surely of your verses being hacked
in cheep schools. If you are 1 em not. I look for the applause of better judgee. Am
1 to be put out by the abuse of a vulgar rabble? Let my noble band of learned and
leving friends be pleesed and 1 want no more. Demetrius and Tigellius may go end
whine to their pupils. And εο, boy, let this be my valediction to them all.
