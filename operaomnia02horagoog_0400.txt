SATIRE V.

In the year anne. 714, atter the taking of Perusia by Augustus, M. Antonius prepared
for ver, which was aven-ted by an arrangement made through the mediation of Maecenas
on the part of Augustus, and of Cocceius end Pollio ou the part of Antonius, and by the
marriage of Octavia, Augustus' sister, to Antonius. But that this was not the occasion
of the journey recorded in this Satin is certaixt, because Horace vas not introduced t
Maecenas till the beginning of Ama. 716. The same objection, among several others,
inflata! to the theory which connects the journey with the spring of the year 716. At
that time M. Antonius arrived at Brundusium with his fleet at the requert of Augdstus,
who had asked him for help against Sex. Pompeium but not finding Augustus there, he
very soon took his departure. This is the date adopted, among many others, by Heindorf.
It has been dispoeed of by Kirehner (Quaen. Hor. 656, sqq.) in a way that cannot be
ansvered. In the spring of the following year 717, Antonius brought over an army to

Italy, and a fleet of 300 ships (Appian, v. 933 Dion Cass. ⁴8. 54; Plut. Ant. c. 35)= .

ἔκ τινων διαβολῶν παροξυνθεὶς πρὸς Καίσαρα, says Plutarch. He pretended, Dion
says, to come for the purpose of helping to put down Sex. Pompeius, his real object
being rather to see what vas goingon than to take any active part. He came to
Brundusium, but the people would not let him come into the harbour (according to
Plutarch), and he therefore went on to Tarentum. Negon'ations were carried on between
the two rivale (Caesar being at Rome) through agents employed by both, but without
effect, till Octavia undertook to mediate between her husband and brother, and was
finally successful in reconciling them. It has been supposed, with every probability, that
the mission which Horace accompanied was sent by Augustus to meet Antonius on hls
expected arrival at Brundusium on this occasion, i. e. in the spring of lun-c. 717. That
the seaeon was not winter may be inferred from v. 14, where Horace speaks of being dis-
turbed by the gnate and frogs. That it was not nmmer is probable from the party
requiring a lire at Trivieum (v. 80). Appian (l. e.) states expressly that Antonius arrived
at Brundusium ἦρος ἀρχομένου, which correspouds with the above facts.

Horace started from Rome with only one companion‚ Heliodorus the rhetorician (v. 2) ,
and these two travelled together three days and one night, about fisty-six miles, till they
reached Tarracina or Anxur, where by appointment they were to meet the official mem-
bers of their party. These were Maecenas and Cocceius, who had been employed in
negotiating the first reconciliationi between Augustus and Antonius, and Fonteius, au
intimate friend of the latter. Three days afterwards they met at Sinuessa Horace's three
most intimate friends, Plotius Tucca, Varius, and Virgih oue of whom, Varius, kept
them company only for six days, and left them, for reasons which are net mentioned, at
Canuaium (v. 93). The reat of the party went on toguthoe till they reached Bnndusium,
