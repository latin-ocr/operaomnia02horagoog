CARMEN XXII.

Horace on some occasion thought fit to dedicate e. pine in his gurden to Diana, and his
commentatore have suggested various reasons and occasions for hie doing 80. One thinks

it may have been when he first had possession of his farm, which enablee him to fix the
dateofthe ode; another that he hed had an escape from the amckof uboerpiffl the
F‘reneh editors heve settled it was on the arrival of news that one of his misia-em had

nounced to be the idlest sort of tiifliug which thus attempta tn fix causes from euch im-
penetrable data, and turns the edge of a pretty trifle like this by forcing it into mutter of

many euch the numerous misti-essee of the poet (une de ees meitresses !) bore him, we
