Ire licet mulo vel si libet usque Tarentum,

HORATII FLAGCI

Mantica cui lumbos onere ulceret atque eques armos:
Objiciet nemo sordes mihi quas tibi, Tim,

Cum Tiburte via praetorem quinque sequuntur

Te pueri lasanum portantes oenophorumque.

Hoc ego commodius quam tu, praeclare senator,

Milibus atque aliis vivo·

Incedo solus; percontor quanti olus ac far;
Fallacem Circum vespertinumque pererro

cum habita et noris quam sit tibi curta
supellex '’ (Pers. S. iv. 52). Others suppose
it to be a stout short-bellied animal. Ι do
not pretend to decide3 but it was an un-
sightly beast, whatever it was Horace
meant.

105. usque Tarentum, ] Along the most
frequented of all the reads, the Via Appia,
and ιο the farthest part of Italy, carrying
his portmanteau behind him. Public officere
could not go beyond a certain distance
from Rome without the permission of the
senate.

107. nlla· ,] Orelli assumes that this is
the person mentioned before (v. 24) as
military tribune, aud that he was afterwards
made praetor. But 1 do not see why
Horace should have mentioned him in the
lower office at a time when he must have
held a ffigher. He appears to have been a
parsimonious person, going into the country
with no company of friends, but only five
slaves to attend him (see note ou S. i. 3. ll),
carrying a ᾔει· of their master's cheap wine,
and an utensil that ill represented the
dignity of his curule chair. The Via Tibur-
tina leit Rome by the Esquiline gate, and
bore that name as far as Tibur, from whence
the Via Valeria completed the communica-
tion with Atemum on the Adriatic.

111. Milibue atque aliis] This is the
reading of all the MSS. Lambinus cou-
jectured ⁸ multis,' and Heindorf has adopted
that word, considering that ⁸ milia ' in the
plural is always a substantive. But that' is
not the case. See note on S. ii. 3. 197.

112. quanti olus ac sam] Horace
means, as Orelli says, that he lounges iu
the market and talks freely to the mai-ket
peobple, withouzfger of lowering his dignity
or ein remar e .

113.gFallacem Circum] Comm. Cruq.

more properly ‘Samardaci ⁹) is a Greek

word, the origin of which is unknown. it
was adopted by ecclesiastical writers. Au-
gustin (cont. Academ. iii. 15) uses it for an
impostor, while Chrysostom interprete it
γελωτόποιος. Plautus (Poenulus, tf». 11)
allude· to a class of cheats who frequented

the Circus: —

“Itaque replebo, atr-itate atrior multo ut
Quiriti? Aegyptii aut qui cortinam ludis

and Cicero (de Divin. i. 58) declares his un-
belief in all those impostore that pretend
ιο prophetie and mystical knowledge, in
the words of Ennius ³-

“ Νοιι habeo nauci Marsum augura,
Non vicanos haruspioee, non de circo

where‘ spatium utrinque metarum' means
the area on either side of the‘ spina‚' or
central wall that ran down the middle of
the Circus, at each end of which were the

farther on, in allusion ιο the same praefice,
