Sive per Syrtes iter aestuosas 5
Sive facturus per inhospitalem
Caucasum vel quae loca fabulosus

Lambit Hydaspes,

 

Namque me silva lupus in Sabina,

Dum meam canto Lalagen et ultra.

Terminum euris vagor expeditis,

Quale portentum neque militaris

Nec J ubae tellus generat leonum

5. per Syrtes iter accinetae] This cen-

syrten but along the hurning coust thet
bordere on them. “Non aestuosae grate

epithet ‘ssfnbulosus und the amount of

‘expedio’ admits of two constructione. Se'o
Cat-111. 31. 7. ‘O quid solutis est beatius

metum, Teucriss' Aen. i. 562. Horace says
(C. iii. 24. 8)· . ·ιιοιι animum metu Non
mortis laqueis expedies ceput.” 1 think Dil-
lenbr. is right in defeuding ⁶ ‘tis,' not
only by the authority of the MSS„ but for the
cuke of the ὀμοιοτέλευτον, which thie mee-
eure ebounds in. Raida· thie verse there

15. Iubae tellus] It hee been doubted
whether Horace alludet to the elder οι· the
younger J ubo. Orelli hee printed in eu
exem-eus un argument by one of his country-
men in favour of the younger. It seems, us
fer ee Ι cun understand it, to amount to
thie. —thet the sou received et the hande of
Augustus, in place of hie fether’ s kingdom
of Numidia, the whole of maurit-nia, and
thoee perte of Gaetulia which lie contiguous
to the range of Atlas, end thet these were
more productive of wild beante thau Numi-
dia (the. elder suba’ s kingdom), Gaetuliam
lions being proverbial. But the extent of
the futher’ e dominion Horace wus not
likely to define more eccurutely thum Lucan,
wholdssye (iv. 670) it was the widest in the
wor :—

 

’· longissime regueg
cardine eb occiduo vicinus Gadibus Atlas
Terminet: e medio confinis Syrtibus Am-

mon.'’

He was lord, enyo he, not only of the Numi-
dinn but of the Gaetuliun, eud a host of other
tribes, all whichie mere exaggeretion. This
therefore provee nothing, end Horace might
very innocently heve called the whole of
Libye · Jubne tellus.' even ir the elder hul
never had ιι son, οι· thet eon had never risen
in favour with Augustus. eud been invented
with the kingdoms of Mauritania und Gue-
tulie. It ie not however improbable thet
Horace, who noticee the events of the day,
may heve used the phrase in this instance
with reference to the honours newly grent-
ed to the younger J ube, who received the
grant of these parts of Libye Aac. 729.
This would help to su the date of the
ode.
