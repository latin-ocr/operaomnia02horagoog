31. urentes} The MSS. are divided be-

tween this and ⁴ 111-8111883 Acron read

‘,urentes’ as it appears. Four of Orelli' 8
11881 MSS„ with the Leiden of the tenth
century, have the same. He prefers it as
less otiose, and because 811 sands are dry,
but all do not burn as the Syrian beach
does. There is not much in this argument.
The participle of a transitive verb is not
commonly used as an epithet by Horace3
and if ‘ urentes' is neuter, it is not less idle
than ⁴ arentes,' which Bentley, Lambinus,
and Cruquius prefer. Authority seems to
be more in favour of ‘ urentes,' but on their
own merite it would be hard to decide be-

tween the two words. ‘Litoris Assyriiss

Orelli says, may mean either the deserta
east of Syria, in which Palmyra* 18 situated,
or the Syrian coast. ‘Litoris' can hardly
mean any thing but the latter. See note on
0. 11. ll. 16.

33. Visam Britannos] Our ancestors
had a bad name. St. Jerome says he saw
a tribe in Gaul, the Aticoti, of British origin,
eating human flesh (Orelli's note). The
stoi-ies of their human sacrifices are too
authentic to be doubted. See Tacitus (Ann.
xiv. 30), where he says of them, ‘cruore

111. 463) relates of the Geloni that they eat
cheese dipped in horse’s blood. Whether
the Concani, who were a Cantabrian tribe,
did the same is doubtful. Horace perhaps

ot his idea from virgil, and Silius copied

“Nec qui Massageten monstrans feritate

38. addidit] The MSS. appear to be
almost equally divided between this reading
and two others, ‘abdidit ' and ‘reddidit ς’
and Bentley, with Fea and Meinecke, prefer

the last. In the year 11.. n. c. 729, after the
conquest of the Salassi. a people of the
Gaulish Alps (Livy ‚Epis 135. Dion 0888.
53. 25), Augustus assigned their territory
to some of the 111-8811011811 troops, and there
they built Augusta Praetoria (Aosta), and
about the same 111118 there were assigned to
others lands in Lusitania, on which they
built Augusta Emerita (Merida. ⁸ Red-

didit' may be rig ht, but ‘ad dit' is a
word used in 8 like case by Tacitus (Ann.
xiii. 31)= ‘⁸ Coloniae Capua atque Nuceria

comes nearer to ‘abdidit,' which is the
reading of all the Scholiasta, who explain it

thinks ‘abdidit’ much the best. “mirifice
conjunctus cum finiendis veteranorum mili-
tum laboribu8.” The truth lies, in my opi-
nion, between ⁶ reddidit' and ‘ addidit,' and
Ι have given my reason for preren-ing the
latter with Orelli. Lambinus conjectures
ι’1888118 for‘ fessas,' and Bentley 18 much
pileased with the alteration but does not

in 1118 life of Augustus (84, 85 relatas that
he followed literary pursuits with great zeal,
and dabbled 111 poetry. He could not have
11811 much time for such put-suits when this
ode was written, but 118 may have said

enough to let it be seen that he deuired ,

leisure to follow them.
