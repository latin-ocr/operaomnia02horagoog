HORATII FLAOCI

put away his wife and his ehildren; and fixed his eyes upon the ground ς strengthened
the wavering minda of the ἠῶθι-ες and departed among weeping friends a noble
exile. And though he knew the torments that awaited him, he put aside his troops of
friends as ealmly as if he were going down to his home at Venafrum or Tarentum.

GAELo Tonantem credidimus J ovem
Regnare : praesens divus habebitur
Augustus adjectis Britannis
Imperio gravibusque Persis.
Milesne Crassi conjuge barbara 5
Turpis maritus vixit et hostium,
Pro curia inversique mores!
Consenuit socerorum in armis
Sub rege Medo Marsus et Apulus,

Anciliorum et nominis et togae

Oblitus aeternaeque Vestae,
Incolumi Jove et urbe Romai

1. Caelo Tbnantem] Orelli does right
to take ‘ regnare ⁹ with ⁸ eaelo,’ making ‘ To·
nantem ⁹ absolute. ‘ Credidimus ⁹ bas the
common foros of the aorist. ⁶:me
which Dillenbr. takes in the sense notioed
on C. i. 35. 2, is obviously §praesens in ter-
ris,⁹ as opposed to‘ caelo!

3. acb‘ectis] This means ‘when he shall
have added) It cannot mean. as some under-
stand it, who place the date of the ode aster
the reeovery of the standards from Phraates,
‘ because he has added-⁹ That would be a
direct esser-tion that Augustus had invaded
and subdued Britain, which he never did,
though Strabo says (iv. p. 138) that many of
the native ehiefs had sent to offer their
territories to the acoeptanee of the Romans,
οἰκείαν σχεδὸν παρεσκεύασαν τοῖς Ρω-

μαίοις ὅλην τὴν νῆσον. Horaoe’s object
seems to be to divert men ’s attention from
the Parthian prisoners and past defeat to
new objects of hope and ambition, under
the guidance οἳ Augustus

5. Mileme Graeci] It was about twenty-
eight years since the disastrous campaign of
Crassus, when about mmo Roman soldiers,
and several eagles, were left in the hands of
the Parthians. Orelli says Horace does not
allude to M. Antonius’ losses in the same
qum-ter eighteen years afterwards, partly
beenuse it would have been indelieate to-
wards Augustus, and partly bemuse of his
affection for his son L. Antonius.

— conjuye barbara— maritus] ovid
uses this consuunt-ion ( Hei-oid. iv. 1342}

“Et fas omne facit fratre marita soror)

Virgil exclaims with the same horror ol
Antonius, ‘⁴ Sequiturque (nefas) Aegyptia
ἓξᾞὲἒ.. ἑθὲἓζῗῑὲθθὲωᾞίἓᾚξοζ
only had not‘ connubium' with Rome, but
were her enemies.

7. Pro curia inversique mores !] Orelli
ῗιαὲιῗο. ,prou εῧτωέξέἰῗέὴῗωὲἓὲ ωτιηὶιιςᾱψ
according to circumstances. It ie followed
by the nominative or accusative. In tho
common exclamation “ pro deum hominnm-

ue fidem 1⁹· the accusative is always used.
See the explanation of that phrase in Mr.
Long⁹s note on Cic. Divin. in Caecil. 3.)

8. ia ιιι-πώ] Jani quotes one MS.
which has‘ arvis. ⁹ This reading Bentley
adopts aster Tan. Faber, and Heinsius. But
there is nothing to prevent our sup
the Roman prisoners served' ιιι the Parthian
armies. As slaves they would be forced to
do so, and they might do it wil-lingly, aa
Labienus did, who was not a prisoner. It
is Horaee⁹ s purpose at least to make it ap-
Ρθῗιὸώἑξιέὶιέοωνιῷι] This genitive, from
⁸ ancile,⁹ is anomalous. Foreellini points
out a similar irregularity in ‘ Saturnaliornm,'
and Orelli adds ⁸ sponsaliorum) Hor-aee
eolleets the most distinguished objeets οἰ a
Roman’s reverenee, his name, his citizen·
ship (togae), the shield of Mars only to be
lost, and the fire of Vesta ouly to be extin-
guished, when Rome should perish. Florus
(iv. 11. 3) says of M. Antonius, that hewaa
