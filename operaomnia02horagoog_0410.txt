SATIRARUM Ι. 5.

Tendimus hinc recta Beneventum, ubi sedulus hospes
Paene macros arsit dum turdos versat in igni 3
Nam vaga per veterem dilapso flamma culinam

Volcano summum properabat lambere tectum.

Convivas avidos coenam servosque timentes

Tum rapere, atque omnes restinguere velle videres,
Incipit ex illo montes Apulia notos ’
Ostentare mihi, quos torret Atabulus et quos
Nunquam erepsemus nisi nos vicina Trivici

71. Beneventum] The Appia Via took
a north-east turn from Caudium for ten
miles till it came to Beneventum (Bene-
vento), a very ancient town, by tradition
said to have been founded by Diomed, and
the name of which was originally, when the
Samnites had it, Maleventum, or some name
that sounded so like Maleventum to a Latin
ear that the Romans thought fit to change
it (for good luck) to Beneventum. In no
town but Rome are there so many remains
of ancient art found as in Benevento. Nearly
all the walls are built os altars, tombs,
columns, διας and the arch of Trajan, erec-
ted probably in commemorationi of his con-
struction of the read from Beneventum to
Brundusium (since the same year, Aa). 114,
appears on the arch that is found on the
milliary columns along the road), still re-
mains in pretty good preservation. Thither
the party proceeded next day, and put up
at an inu, when the host nearly set fire to
his house through carelessness in roasting
some indifferent thrushes for their dinner.
⁴ Hospes paene arsit,’ the host nearly got
himself on fire, means that he nearly burnt
the house down, as the context shows. The
ffiffsszsssszdzmffiegfflffl {⁹32}ss
tion of ⁴ macros' is a little careless; and
Lambinus, followed by most of the editors
of his time and by Fea, transposed ‘ macros’
and ‘arsit,' on the authority of one MS„
the value of which is not known. Bentley
found that arrangement in another of no
weight. The rest have all ‘ Paene macros
arsit! -

78. quos torret Atabulus] This Gellius
(ii. 22) reckons among local winds; and
Seneca mentions it (Q. N. v. 17) as infest-
ing Apulia ι “ Atabulus Apuliam infestat,
Calabriam Iapyx, Athenas Sciron, Galliam
Circius.” Pliny likewise says (N. H. xvii.
14)= ‘⁸ Flatus Apulis proprius oet Atabulus:
hic si flaverit circa brumam exurit frigore
arefaciens ut nulfis solibus postea recreari

possit.” This may explain ⁸ torret,' a word
which applies to the effect of cold as well as
heat- It is generally interpreted by the
commentatore by ⁴ scirocco,' a hot land
wind. But it came directly off the sea from
the east, and Pliny speaks of it as a winter
wind. The Scholiasta all derive the name
ἀπὸ τοῦ τὴν ἄτην βάλλειν, which is an
impossible etymology. Cruquius’ Scholiast
says the vulgar corruption of the name was
‘Atabm’ which comes near to the medem
name ‘ Altino!

79. Nunquam· erepsemus] This is one
of the many abbreviated forms Horace uses.
See C. i. 36. 8, n., and to the examples there
given add the present, and also ‘ surrexe,’
⁸ divisse,' ‘ evasti.' ‘ Vixet,' in Aen. xi.
118, is a like conti-action of the same tense
as ‘erepsemus.’ Horace says that theywould
never have got out of these hills (the range
that borders Samnium and sepsi-ates it from
Apulia) had they not found an inn at the
town of Trivicum, described by Swinburne
(vol. i. p. 130 as “a baronial town on an
eminence, an still ealle‘d Trevioo, a mar-
mstssmffl'tm, 2532?ss
to put up for the night. He means the next
stage, which was twenty-four miles further
on, would have been too long a journey.
Horace had been familiar with these moun-
tains in his early childhood, for they over-
looked his native town. ‘ Notos ’ refers to
these early reminiscences. ‘ Trivicum ’ is
not mentioned in the Itinerary of Antoninus,
or the Jerusalem Itinerary. It was pro-
bably on a cross rond (Cramer, ii. 259)
which lay between the two branches of the
Appia Via, one of which took the most
direct course from Beneventum through
Venusia to Tarentum and Brundusium, and
the other took a more northerly course
across the Apennines‚ near Equus 'lhiticus3
and then, striking directly eastward till it
arrived very near the sea-coast, near Cannae,
proceeded down the line of coast till it
