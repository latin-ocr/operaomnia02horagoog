drawing the wine from the‘ diota' (which
is the same as the‘ amphora‚' ‘ftesta or
⁶-cadus ') into the mter or bowl ιιι which
it was mixed with water. Here it means the
latter. The name of the wine is applied to
the vessel containing it here, as in ‘Graeca
testa' (i. 2⁰. 2); ⁸ Laestrygonia amphora’
(iii. 16. 34). Sabine wine was not among the
best, nor was it of the worst sort. It was
a sweet wine, and probably aiter four years’
keeping was in its prime. Horace calls it
elsewhere (C. i. 20. l)
but that was as com

the Caecubus ager in the south of latium, at
the head of the hay of Amyclae ε the second
in rank was the Falernian, of which there
were several varieties, in connexion with
which he mentions an inferior sort from
Surrentum (also in Campania), which was
improved by mixing with Falernian dregs
(S. ii. 4. 55). On a par with Falernian he
seems to place the wine of the Alban hilis
(S. ii. 8. 16). The wine of the Messio range
was apparently of delicate flavour (S. ii. 4.
54). Among the costly wines of the rich
he mentions the Caleuian trom Cales, now
Calvi, in Campania, and that of the Formian
hilis (C. i. 2⁰. 9, 11). The worst wine he
speaks of (S. ii. 3. 143) was from the neigh-
bourhood of Veii, a red wine (Mart. i. 104.
9, “Veientani bibitur faex massa rubelli”).
There were other wines of different qualities
grownin Italy, which Horace does not hap-
pen to mention, the best of which and placed
by Augustus above Caecuban, was the Seti-
nian from Setia in the Volscian territory,
now Sezza (Westphal says a go'od wine
is still grown there). The Romans had

also imported wines from the Aegean and

Asia Minor, of which Horace mentions
those ftom the islands of Cos, Lesbos, and
Chios. Of these the first was a white wine,
the second seems to have been the least
ppwerfuh the third was most highly valued.

e speaks of Mareotic wine from the
neighbourhood of Alexandria (C. i. 37. 10),
the vine producing which Virgil mentions
(Georg. ii. 91). But it does not appear
that that was druuk at Rome. Further
details will be found in Smith's Dict. Ant.
article ⁴ Vinum,' and the authors there
referred to. Horace’s classification does
not agree altogether with Pliuy’s. But .
there is no article of commerce that under..
goes more variatione in the course of a few
years than wine.

14. Fors] ⁶ Chanes! Cic. (de Leg. ii. ll)
distinguishes ⁶ Fors' from ‘ Fortuna' thus:
“ Fortuna valet in omnes dies3 Fors in quo
incerti casus significantur magis.” ⁸ Fors'
and ‘ Sors' differ ascause and effect:

‘⁴ Qui fit, Maecenas, ut nemo quam sibi
sortem
Seu ratio dederit seu Fors objecerit‚''
(S. i. 1. 1). Nevertheless the Scholiasta Acron
and Porph. appear to have read ⁴ Sors,' and
several editors since. Bentley reads ⁶ Fors!
lucro appone,] Cic. Div. 9. 17: ‘⁴ de
lucro prope jam quadriennium novimus‚''
i. e. of good luck and contrary to expecta-
tion. Liv. (xi. 8) has the same expression:
“ De lucro vivere me scit0.” ⁴ Luctari' is
said of things gained without our own
effort, according to Forcellini' sexplanation.
