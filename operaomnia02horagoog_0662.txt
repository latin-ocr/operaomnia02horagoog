EPISTOLARUM 1. 18. 63⁷

(v. 67.) Tske cere what γοα say of otha-s, and to whom γοα κγ it. 'l'he inquisitive is a
babbler3 avoid hiim he will repeat what you say, and once said it cannot be re-
called. Cast not s longing eye on your patron’s slaves. He may put γοα off with
one ss s present in satisfaction of γοαι· claims, or he may be churlish about it snd
ennoy γοα. Teke care whom you introduce, for you may be brought to shsme by the
ssults of another. If γοα heve ever found a man deceive γοα, get rid of him, end keep
your influence for those who ere fslsely maligne& for may not the same come upon
yourself? Your house is in danger when γοαι· neighbour’s is on fire, and γοα had
better get it under in its beginnings.

(v. 86.) These who have neven· tried it think attendance on the great s migbty ples-snt
thing. He who hss is afraid of it. But ss γοα sre emberked tske these hints for your
guidsnce. The light-heerted like not the solemn, nor the active the slothfuL nor the
slothful the active, nor the drInkers the sober. Put the cloud from γοαι· brow: the
modest is lisble to be counted resen-ved, and the silent sour. And withsl study wine
books and leem the secrete of s quiet life, snd to examine γοαι· own condition3 leam
the murcos of vii-me, the relies: of sorrow, the means of sels-contentment, and inno-
cent tranquillity. ‘

(v. 104.) When 1 retire to reti-enh myself by my own eool mm, what, think γοα, tre
ιαγ reflectione and my dedi-es? Thnt 1 may get no more than 1 have, that 1 may live
for myself, with s good stock of books and e well-stored barn, and s mind calm and
stesdy. Nay, but this 1 will make sor myselfg for the rest 1 will prsy to Jove, for

S1 bene te novi metues, liberrime Lolli,

scurrantis speciem praebere professus amicum. ⁶

Ut matrona meretrici dispar erit atque

Discolor, infido scurrae distabit amicus.

Est huic diversum vitio vitium prope majus, 6
Asperitas agrestis et inconcinna gravisque,

Quae se commendat tonsa oute, dentibus atris,

Dum vult libertas dici mera veraque virtus·

Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum.

Alter in obsequium plus aequo pronus et imi ιο
Derisor lecti sic nutum divitis horret,

Sic iterat voces et verba cadentia tollit,
