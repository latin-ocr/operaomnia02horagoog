CARMINUM IV. 7.

237

Quis scit an adjiciant hodiernae crastina summae

Tempora di superi?

Cuncta manus avidas fugient heredis amico

Quae dederis animo.

20

Cum semel occideris et de te splendida Minos

Fecerit arbitria,

Non, Torquate, genus, non te facundia, non te

Restituet pietas ;

Infernis neque enim tenebris Diana pudicum

Liberat Hippolytum,

25

N ec Lethaea valet Theseus abrumpere caro

Vincula Pirithoo,

15. phedonem] Here Orelli egeln
sei-ts his Berne MS.,which reads with many
others ⁸ pius! All the editors tiu Bentley
lud thet word. His reasons for adopting
⁴ pota· ⁹ are, first the authority of better
MSS„ especially the oldest Blendininn, end,
eecondly‚ that ⁸ pietas ⁹ occurs below v. 24).

Noitha· do 1 think offmmy’notim'a, thfft
⁶ pins ' and ⁸ dives ' would eound too much
like opposition, es if Aenees were poor end
Tullus rich, of any weight. Bentley pro·
3:³3: ἕοῗεῗὲῖὲᾶέἶῗᾷἐὲω ’Ξίψὲζὲἶῗὲ
hae no euthogisty, and nomez?- purpose is
to show thet no means ere sufficient to bring
buck the deod, not piety, nor weelth, nor
power. 1 heve on this assumption adopted
‘pius' es having more meaning here then
‘op-251⁹! There is a similar verse in Epp. i.
‘⁴ IreAntnmep restat Numa quo devenit et

cus. ’

17. Quis ecit] This may or may not be
imitated from Euripides (Alc. 783) :—

de-

oio: ἔστι θνητῶν ὅστις ἐξεπίσταται
τὴν αὔριον μέλλουσαν εἰ βιώσεται.

For ⁴ summae ’ there ure Mss„ end among
others the Blendinian above mentioned,
which read ‘vitee‚’ which also appears in
Ven. 1483, but it is only a gloss. No copy·

ist would heve invented ⁶ summae! ‘Amico
animo dere' seems to be n litei-el version
of φίλῃ ψυχῇ χαρίζεσθαι. Slmonides
says,—

 

βιότου ποτὶ τέρμα
ψυχῇ τῶν ἀγαθῶν τλῆθι χαριζό evoe.
(85 Bergk, su fin.)

21. splendida] This is en unusual word
sor such e meaning. Forcell. interprete it
‘⁴ praeclarum et aequem sententiam et pro-
batem omnibus,” and 1 do not know that
there is any further meaning in the word.
lt may have reference to the august che-
rncter of the tribunal, us Orelli says.

25. Horace follows the Greek legend
respectiug Diana end Hippolytus. ovid
(Met. xv. 543, sqq.) makes him return stom
the dead, being brought to life by the skill
of Aesculapius. See also Aen. vii. 765, sqq.
The common story of Theseus end his friend
is, that both having been consigned to their
punishment together, Hercules went down
and delivered Theseus, leaving Peirithousto
his {ete- 1 do not see why this should not
be the legend Horace follows: it may be
understood thet Theseus pleaded for Peiri-
thous when he was himself returning, but
failed to obtain his release. Dillenbr. sup.
poses Horace to heve followed some different
legend or to have altered the common one

himself.
