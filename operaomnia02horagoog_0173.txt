HORATII FLACOI

same time. That Horace was still a frequenter of Baiae appears fremy. 24. But when
he wrote Epp. i. 15, which was probably composed mmo. 731, he had been forbidden by
the doctor to go there, which Franke also notices as limiting the date of the ode.

ARGUMENT.

Come down, Calliope, and sing a losty sta-ain. Is it a dream or am I wandering in the
Muses' grove? I was a child, and tired with play 1 lay down to sleep οιι the Apulian
hills. There <loves made me a covering of leaves, and 1 slept safe, and men might well

wonder how the gods were present with me. Yours am I, ye Muses, on the Sabine hills,
at Tibur, at Praeneste, or at Baiae. Because 1 love your fountains and your cheir
1 perished not when the battle was turned, nor by the accursed nee, nor in the Sicilian
wetere. Be ye with me and 1 will visit the mad Bosporus, the sande of the Καὶ, the
savage Briton, the Concan, the Geloni, and the Tanais, unharmed. Ye reli-esh Augustus
when he brings back his weary troops from the war. Mild are your counsels, and
in peace is your delight. We know how that bold giant band struck terror into
the heart of Jove; but what was their strength against the aegis of Pallas? ’Τινει that
which drove them back, though Vulcan too, and Juno, and Apollo with his bow, were
there. Brute force falls sels-destroyed: the gods detest violence, but tempered strength
they promote: let Gyas be my witness, Orion the seducer, Barth mourning for her sons,
Aetna with its ever-burning and unconsuming flame, the vulture of Tityus, and the
chains of Peirithous.

DascENDE caelo et dic age tibia

Regina longum Calliope melos,
Seu voce nunc mavis acuta,
Seu fidibus citharaque Phoebi.
Auditis, an me ludit amabilis 5
Insania? Audire et videor pios
Errare per lucos amoenae
Quos et aquae subeunt et aurae.

Me fabulosae Vulture in Apulo

Altricis extra limen Apuliae

Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum palumbes

2. longum] This seems to mean a sus·
tained and stately song. There· ιε a little
likeness between this opening and a frag-
ment of Alcman (29 Bergk)= -

Mel'm’ ἆγε Καλλιόπα, θῦ (περ Διός,
ἄρχ’ ἐρατῶν ἐπέων ἐπὶ δῖ’ ἵμερον
ὕμνον και χαρὶεντα τίθει χορόν.

4. citharaque] The balance of authority
is in favour of‘ ve, 'but the sense is against
it. There is no opposition between‘ ci-
thara' and ‘fidibus. ' They mean the same
thing. Bentley as usual prefers‘ ve, ’which
got into the MSS. probably from a cai-eleas
reference to ‘ seu.'

6. piosErrarepcr lucos] See C. iv. 2.27.

9. fabulosae] The Scholiasta take this

with‘ altricisss but lt clearly belong-s to‘ pa·
lumbes' the‘ ston’ed doves,' as ‘fabulosus
Hydaspes’ (C. i. 22. 8). The range of the
Apennines that bore the name ‘Vultur' was
partlyin Apulia and partly in Lucania.
It is still called Monte Vulture. Ve-
nusia, Horace' s birth· place, was near the
boundary of those provinces, whence he
calls Apulia his nurse, though elsewhere
(S. ii. l. 34) he says it is doubtful whether
he was au Apulian or a Lus-anian. Bentley
expresses the greatest contempt for this, the
ordinary interpretation, and proposes to read
‘nutricis extra limina sedulae’ taking‘ nu-
trix' literally. For that word he has au-
thority. The eldest Berne hesit ι but ⁶ limina
sedulae ⁷ is his own invention. Orelli says
