Udos cum foliis ramos urente camino,

Nocturnam vestem maculant ventremque supinum.

reached Brundusium. Pristim, supported
by Becker (Gallus, Sc. iv. n.) denies that
the northern rond was called Via Appia,
which name, he says, belongs only to the
direct road through Venusia. But even that
he thinks doubtful, since Strabo confines
the name to that part of the rosd which lay
between Rome and Beneventum= rotv-
τεῦθεν δ’ ἤδη μέχρι τῆς Ῥώμης Ἀππὶα
καλεῖται (vi. 283. Cas..) Cramer says ‘⁸ the
little town of Trivico, which appears on a
height above the course of the ancient Ap-
pian way, points out the direction of that
roadg aud some ruins, which are said to be
visible below it, probably represent the farm
which affor-ded a lodging to Horace and his
fellow travellers ;'' than which latter con·
jecture nothing can be less probable in my

opinion.

81. camina] See Epod. ii. 43, n.

87. Mansuri oppidulo] It appears pro-
bable that the road on which Trivicum lay,
entering Apulia about ten miles from that
town, passed through or near the Apulian
Asculum (Asculi), and it is in that neigh-
bourhood that the little town with the un-
rhythmical name, at which the party stopped
atter Triviam, is now generally supposed
to have stood. Equus Tuticus is the place
fixed upon by the Scholiaste3 hut that town
was nearci- Beneventum than Trivicum, and,
by the shortest computation of the Itine-
raries, was sixty-three Roman miles from
Canusium, Horace's next resting place. It
may be assumed that the town, which was
hut a small one, and inconvenient in his
time, has lest no traces of ite site3 and of
its name we must be content to be ignorant.
It was not situsted on the Appia Via, which
the cros· road did not ιἰοὶη till it reached
(Orelli says, 1 do not know on what autho-
rity or data) the place which in the Jerusa-

lem Itinerary is called ‘ ad Undedmum‚’
being eleveu miles from Canusium, and now,
he says, called Cer-ignols. It is equally pro-
bahle‚ looking at the relative position of
Trivicum and Canusium, that the two roada
met near the left bank of the Aufidus.

89. ultra] This is the reading of all the
known MSS. Aldus (1501) first introduced
‘ ultro ς’ aud a few editors,—1·1. Stephenffi
Muretus, Baxter, and others,-—have adopted
it. 1 cannot understand why Orelli says

91. Nam Canusi lapidosum] In a plain
between the hius and the right bank of the
Aufidus (D’Anville incorrectly places it ou
the lest), about twelve mila from its mouth,
stood the town of Canusium (canosa), one
of the ancient Greek settlements of Apulia.
