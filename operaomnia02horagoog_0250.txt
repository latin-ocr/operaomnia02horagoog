CARMEN IV.

A.U.C. 739.

The history of this odeis easily made out. The Vindelici were a tribe whose territorias
lay between the Danube and the lake of constance, comprising the greater part of
medem Bavaria and Suabia, and some part of the Tyrol. The Raeti lay ιο the south
os the Vindelici, and reached to Lake Come on the south. These tribes, whom the
historiam describe as very sterce and warlike, commenced a system of predatory incur-
sione into Cisalpine Gaul, in which they appear ιο have praetised the greatest οιτο-
citiea (Dion Cass. liv. 223 Strabo, iv. 6). Augustus was at this time (mmo. 738—39)
in Trumpine Gaul, and Tiberius was with him. Drusus, his step-eon, and younger brother
of Tiberius, was Quaestor at Rome, and in his twenty-third year. He was required by
Augustus to take the field against the offending tribes, whom he met under the ‘l'ridentine
Alps and defeated aignally. But though driven from Italy they continued their attacks
upon Gaul, and Tiberius was accordingly sent by Augustus with more troops ιο his
brother’a assistance, and they between them effectually humbled the tribes, whose terri-
tories were constituted a Roman province under the united name of Raetiae, Raetia
Prima, or Proper, and Secunda, which embraced the possessions of the Vindelici: these
also compr-ised several other tribes, of whom Horace particularly mentions the Genauni
and Breuni. The whole of this war took place in the spring and summer of the year
mmc- 739, and weare led to suppose from C. iv. 14. 34-38, that it was brought to a con-
clusion in the mouth of August on the anniversary of the, capture of Alexandria by
Augustus in the year 724 (C. i. 37, Introduction). In honour of these victories Horace
compoaed this ode and the fourteenth of this book, the one more expressly to celebrate
the name of Drusus, the other of Tiberius. The two odes therefore must hietorically be
viewed together. whether they were written while the wara were yet fresh, or on the
return of Augustus to Rome in the year A.u.c. 741, is doubted3 but 1 incline to think
they were written at different times, and should rather, from the character of the odes
themselves, infer that the first was written immediately· on the tidings of Drusus’ victory
before his brother joined him; and that the second, which has much less spirit in it, was
compoeed on Augustus' return and by his desire, as a supplement to the first. The popu-
larity of Drusus and the hopes that were entertained of him would create much enthu-
siasm at Rome on the occasion of his successes 'in his first campaign, and there is a hearty
and vigorous tone about the fourth ode which does not appear so conspicuously in the
fourteenth. Here the praises of Drusus are uppermostin the poet's mind, there Augus-
tus is the real theme, and Tiberius can hardly be said to bear more than the second part.
Nevertheleea Ι agree with Franks in thinking it improbable Horace would have written
the fourth ode without an allusion to Tiberius, if his victorico in conjunction with his
brother had taken place, or been known at Rome when he composed it. There is indeed
tacit reference ιο Tiberius in v. 283 but not more than was unavoidable in alluding ιο
Augustus a· the fountain of those virtues which appeared in Drusus. Not to have
alluded to Tiberius would have been as unnatural aa to have omitted a more specific
