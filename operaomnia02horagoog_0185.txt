HORA'I'II FLAGOI

Inter mariti vina, neque eligit
Oui donet impermissa raptim
Gaudia luminibus remotis;
Sed jussa coram non sine conscio

Surgit marito, seu vocat institor

Seu navis Hispanae magister,
Dedecorum pretiosus emptor.
Non his juventus orta parentibus
Infecit aequor sanguine Punice,

Pyrrhumque et ingentem cecidit

Antiochum Hannibalemque dirum ς

of Aristophanes (rheam. 163), which it is
not improbable Horace may have had in
mind. speaking of the combination of music
and poen-y, he says os the great lyrie poete
that they ἐμιτροφόρουν τε καὶ διεκλῶντ’
Ἰωνικῶς. -The function of tecching to
dance was performed by slaves, Pantomimi,
whom Ovid (A. A. iii. y351) calls‘ ⁴artifices
lateiis, scenae s ,” and Seneca
⁴⁴ mancipia pantomimorum '' (Ep. 47). 'ri-
bei-ius possed a dea-ee that they should
never appear in public except on the stage
(Tac. Anu. i. 77), which explains Ovid’s
expression.

23. Iam nunc] Tite meaning of ⁴ jam
nunc ' is sufficieutly marked in A. P. 432

44 0ιέΠώ haec virtus erit et Venus, sut ego
or,
Ut ὼ,ιιιιιιν nunc dicat jam nunc debentia
οι.’

4 Nunc ’ is ⁴ now‚’ and ⁴ jam ' gives intensive
force to‘ nunc! ‘Jam jamque’ expresses

‘what is e every moment' Key,
L. G. 1460, e.‚) but hes not 'happene yet.
The commentators mix up ‘Jam nunc 'and
si? ”53:13³ ’.ζὲ ἷῗῖ. ’ἷῗαῗιέῑὲἔῗῖἓ
nunc minam, ’.‚&c ·⁴thus ‘fingit se jamjam
vel ante lectam Ahnii curam in medias res
abreptum οπο. ” Horace says directly a
girlhas grown up she is tri-ained bylasci-
vious teachiug aud turns her thoughts to

unchaste plessures. The expression ‘de te-
nero ungui’ is taken from the Greek ἐξ
ἀπαλῶν’ ονύχων, which signifies⁴ from ten-
der years) when the nails are delicate, and
such is the meaning here3 but it does not
contradict ‘matura ’ as some suppose: the
expression will appl to ι girl in the earliest
stage of womanhoody. Ι do not follow Orel-
li’s punctuation. Cicem, in his sixth letter
to Lentulus, says, 44 praesta tecum qui mihi

a teneris ut Graeci dicunt unguiculis es cog-
nitus.” The Greeks appear from Cicero' s
statement to have used the phrase p-rova·
bially, but it is only found ιιι ιιι Epigram of
Automedon in the Authology (Br. ii. 2⁰7).
in which the writer probably had regu-d to
Horace’s ode, as Mitsch. observes.

26. Inter—vina ,] The same form occurs
in Eppfl 1. 7. 283⁴ ad vina’ in C.' iv. 5. 81.

27. imper-micea] This word occurs no
where else. 4 intermissa ' and 4 improvisa’
have thus got into some MSS. in place of
the true reading. ‘'Inconcessus is used
by Virgil and ovid, and Horace uses ‘inter-
dicta.' Orelli contradicts himself. He here
treats⁴ impermissa' as ‘interpolatim’ but
inhisV. 1.., oniv. 7. 10, where⁴ imperi·

‘interitus-ae he says this makes it very

doubtful which is the true reading hene,
‘im 'or ‘intel-missa!

29. Sed jussa coram] The connivance
of the husband at the wickedness of the
wife is touched by Juvenal in his first
Satire (56, sqq.). Metals appear to have
been the chief articles imported from Spain,
with red lead and those stones which vave
polisbed into min-ors, whatever stones those
may have been. See Plin. N. H. iii. 3.

32. Dedecet-um] Bentley’s interpretation
of this as ⁴ res pro persona' is hardly worth
{233252530'323031122³;„{.⁷.·.{:.⁸;²f¹’5¹{:¹.2:
