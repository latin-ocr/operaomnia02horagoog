⁸Nauta piger saxo religat stertitque supinus..

Jamque dies aderat, nil cum procedere lintrem

Sentimus‚ donec cerebrosus prosilit unus

Ac mulae nautaeque caput lumbosque saligno

Fuste dolat: quarta vix demum exponimur hora.
. Ora manusque tua lavimus, Feronia, lympha.

Milia tum pransi tria repimus atque subimus

Impositum saxis late candentibus Anxur.
Huc venturus erat Maecenas optimus atque
Cocceius, missi magnis de rebus uterque
Legati, aversos soliti componere amicos.

Hic oculis efgo nigra meis collyria lippus
Interea Maecenas advenit atque

Illinere.

Threemiles further, on the topos asteep
asoent,·toodfflecownof·1'amcina(‘1·em-
cina), which by the Volscians was called
Anxur, by which name it is always men-
tioned by the poeta. ovid (Met. xv. 717)
calls it nachan, after that which Strabo
(v. 233) says was ita original name, Tra-
china, given it hythe Greeks, from its
rough situation (τραχεῖα). The winding of
the read up the hill, and the difficulty of
the secent, explains the word ‘strepimus
The old town of Tarracina was built on the
top ofthehill, but this sitewasasterwsrds
abandoned and a new town built on the
plain below, close upon the shore, which' ιι
the site of the modern Terracina. It was
in Horace's day, and had been for a long
time, and long continued to be, a town of
great importance, as it was one of great
antiquity. Porphyrion mentions that in
his time the ruina of the old town and its
walls were standing. What that time was
is quite uncertain, —not earlier, however,
than the fifth cent After leaving the

usually eatan ι ut noon, but sometimes
earliery, as probably was the case in this
instance.

27. Huc ventum erat] See Introduc
tion. Bentley thinks ‘optimus' too fami-
liar an epithet for Maecenas, and joina it
with Cocceius. For the same raason hc
alters‘care' into ‘clare' (αἱ-20 5).
L. CocceinsNoevawas afriendof M. An-
tonius, aud wasamong those whom Augustus
found in Perusia when he took it (A. υ. o.
713). He offered these ns no in·
dignity, but made stiends of thern, and

Cocceius seems to have become especially
intimate with Augustus without betraying
his fnendshi sor M. Antonius. According
to Appianv v.,6o sqq.) it was this Lucius
Cocceius who· by his tact and good sense
was the means of bringing about the recon-
ciliation which took place (Α. u. c. 714) be-
tween his two friends. But Lucius had, aa
Ap pian mentions, a brother, and these two
luiire been confounded. The brother' s
name was Marcus· whereas Appian men-
tions this Cocceius expressly as Lucius.
Arm-wc ἦν Κοκκήιος ἑκατέρῳ φίλος. Ur-
sini (Fam. Rom. p. 65) thinks Lucius here
is a mistake sor Marcus, and there is some
ground' ιι Appian' s own statement for sup-
posing such* ιι the case. He says of Coc-
ceius arguing with Antonius, οὐκ εἷα πυ
τὸν Καίσαρα καλεῖν ἐχθρὸν, lc rs Λεύκιον

ἀοι) was not the person w ose lifewas
span-ed at Perusia, hut his brother. But
the former is called Lucius ς the negodater,
therefore, was, according to this account,
Marcus. This Marcus was probably great-
igjrandsgther of the Emperor Nerva. See

30. agyga meis collyria lippus] ⁸-Colly
rium, 'an ointanent for sore eyes, was com-
posed,accordingtoCelsus(l.vi. c-7,)of
juicea expressed from the poppy and various
shrubs, as the lycium, glaucion, scacis,
hypocystis, διο. The etymology of the
word· ιι not known.
