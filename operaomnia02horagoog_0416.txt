SATIRARUM I. 6.

N ec quod avus tibi maternus fuit atque paternus

Olim qui magnis legionibus imperitarent,

Ut plerique solent, naso suspendis adunco ⁵
IgnotOS, ut me libertino patre natum.

Cum referre negas quali sit quisque parente

Natus dum ingenuum, persuades hoc tibi vere,

Ante potestatem Tulli atque ignobile regnum

Multos saepe viros nullis majoribus ortos

Et vixisse probos amplis et honoribus auetos;

4. moysis leyionibus imperitarent,] Be-
cause Maecenas' ancestors are commonly
called ⁸ reges,' Fea changes ⁸ legionibus'
into ⁸ regionibus,’ and he has the authority
of one MS. in his favour, which he calls
the ‘⁸ codex chisianus.’' 1 do not know its
value. But there is no objection to ⁸ le-
gionibus’ in the sense of armies, which is
the reading of all other MSS. and editions.
Lucretius may have said (iii. maim:

‘⁴ Inde alii multi reges rerumque potentes

Occiderupss 11133818 qui gentibus imperita-

runt.

But that does not prove that Horace wrote
⁸ regionibus! The MSS. vary in the form
of the verb, some having the perfect indica-
tive ⁸ imperitarunn' others the perfect sub-
junctive ‘imperitaiint.' But the imperfect
seems to be required, and Bentley says that
that tense, rather than the perfect, always
does follow‘ fuit qui,’ as below, Epp. 11. 2.
128, sqq. In prose there can be no doubt
the subjunctive would be required here (see
Key’ s L. G. 1189), audreq the imperfect is
required by the sense, which does not mean
to limit the statement to one of Maecenas’
ancestors, but to a 8880888108 of them. It
seems from inscriptions to have been the
tam& ἱξῆξέἓᾞξῗίἒὲῗῗ ,ἱοοῖιῒέῖ
well as their father.

5. uaso suspendis adunco] This the
Greeks expressed by μυκτηρίζειν. Το say
that it is a metap hor taken from the saga-
Ξῗωοὲ, 2¹2,ss ἔῖοῗέ οἲῃῖἓζῗῗιὲὶἲζηᾱῗξ.. ¹5..ss
instinctive motion of the features which ex-
presses contempt. How to account for it
may not be easy though it is 8ο common.
The expression ‘naso ndere' Ι 008-
ceive Horace invented, unless it were a sort

of 81383 of the day.1t occurs no where
8188, except in Persius (8. i. 118), where it
23¹³& (ῗέιῗῗοῖἓ ffliffifflflfflssss
though he modifica the expression and
gives it a better 88888. lt is repeated
below, S. ii. 8. 64· “Balatro suspendens
omnia naso.'’ ‘'Ut occurring twice in
these two lines introduces confusion. The
second means ⁸ as for instance! ¹

6. libertino patre natum] The differ-
enee between ‘libertus ' and ⁸ libertinus ' is,
that the latter expressed generically a man
who had been manumitted, the former the
same man in his relation to the master who
had given him his freedom. Orelli (on
v. 40 of this Satira) retains the notion that
‘libertinus ' means the son of a ‘liban-tna:
s meaning which, if it ever existed, did not
belong to the word in Horace’s time. He
expressly says his father was a ⁸ libertinus!
If so, he must have been ‘ingenuus,’ ac-
cording to this definition ; but he was not.
(See Dict. Ant„ art. ‘libertus.’) The son
of 3 ⁸ libertinus' born after his father-'s
manumission, and all other persons born
free, were ι;11138ι181·’ and Horace says that
Maecenas, though he would not take into
his intimacy 3 freedman, made no enquiry
as to the parentage of any one born free,
but would ¹'make him his friend if he de—
served it. Acron interprets⁸ ingenuus' as

“ad moris probitatem pertinens. ” And
some editors (Gesner among them) have
followed him. I do not agree with them.

9. Ante potestatem Tulli] Horace here
follows the legend which made Servius
mlius the son of a slave-girl, and himself

aslave in the palace of King Tarquinius.
08 this account 1118 reign was ignoble,
while in true nobility it was surpassed by
none of the others. Another legend (which
Ovid follows, Fast. vi. 627, sqq.) makes
Tullius the son of Vulcan, but his mother is
there also 3 slave, having been taken captive
at Corniculum, a city taken by Tarquinius
