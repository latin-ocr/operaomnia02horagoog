SATIRARUM II. 2.

Ad casus dubios fidet sibi certius? Hic qui

ment altogether by adopting Heinsius’ con-
jecture ⁶ eunt' for ‘er-unt! Horace’s man
argues that he is so rich that he never can
be otherwise.

107. Uter-ne Aa casus dubios] On ‘ ne,’
see S. i. 10. 21, aud with ‘ dubios,' compare
C. iv. 9. 36: “ Secundis temporibus dubiis-
que rectus.'’

ιιι. aptarit] ⁸ Has fitted on his armour ²
as it were.

113. latius] This word, for which ‘lau-
tius ' and ‘laetius ' have been proposed as
substitutes, is used as ‘ angustius ’ in the op-
posite sense. It means more profusely. 1
am not aware that it is so used any where
· else. ⁴ Mento in agello ' is the farm which
has been marked out hythe public surveyor
(⁸ meoetor'), and assigned ιο Umbrenus.
This participle is used passively in C. ii. 15.
15. ‘Fortem' has been explained in the
note on C. S. 58, and for ‘colonum‚’ see
C. ii. 14. 12, n. As ⁴ colonum ⁹ significa a
tenant, ⁸ mercede ’ is only added ιο give
additional force to the contrast. Ῑι makes
rather a clumsy sentence. Orelli says
⁸ mercede' means a tired share in the pro-
duce. 1 think it only means a sum of

a certain part of the produce of the land ;
but ‘merces ’ could not mean the latter. A
colonus who held on the latter tex-ms was

called ⁶ partiarius! ⁴ Temere ’ signifies that
which is done without consideration, became
habitually done.

122. cum duplice ficu] Some take this
for a large coarse kind of fig (⁶ marisca ’),
double the size of an ordinm-y one (Tutus-
bus xiii. l, Forcellini, and others . Others
take it for a fig split in two, an so dried.
Tbere does not seem to be any authority by
which to decide the question, except that of
Comm. Cruq.. who interprets ⁸ duplice ⁹ by
‘ bifida' It is possible Horace may mean
two figs. '

123. Post hoc ludus erat] This passage
has caused the commentatore not a little
trouble. ‘⁴ Aster this we amused ourselves
by drinking with ‘culpa’ for our ‘magis-
ter,' or ‘ rexbibendi,’ συμποσίαρχος.” But
the question is what ⁶ culpa ' means. It
appears that they agreed between them·
selves as to some mode of drinking, and
established a penalty for the transgression
of it, which transgression (⁴ culpa ⁹) was to
do that which at drinking parties, where a
president was appointed, he might, do arbi-
trarily, that is, either mulct a guest of a cup
of wine, or make him drink an extra cup, or
any thing else he chose, as a fine for misbe-
haviour. In short, Ofella means itwas a quiet
and primitive sort of way of proceeding, un·
like the new fashion introduced from Greece,
and followed in fine houses, of having a sym·
posiarch to preside (S. ii. 6, n ). A scene
of this kind will be found in the Stichus of
Plautus (v. 4). Bentley calls this, which is
