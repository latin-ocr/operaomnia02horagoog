OARMEN XXIX.

In the year of the city 730 an army was aent into Arabia Felix by Antemnatiu-
Aelin· Genus, who wan governor of Egypt. The force chiefly consisted of troope stationed
in that province (Strabo, xvii. ι Γάλλος Αἴλιος μέρει τῆς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ φρουρᾶς εἷς τήν
Ἀραβίαν ἐμβαλὼν, cmx.) · hut the prospect of wealth the expedition held ont, fmm the
indefinite knowledge then possessed of the country, attracted young men at Rome aud
induced, it would seem, Iccius, a man of studione habits, to join it. The expedition vae
attended with nothing but disaster, end the greater part οι· the force pen-iahed. But lecina
survived, and we find Horace writing ιο him a few yeere later as Agrippa'e stewerd ἰιι
Sicily (Epp. i. 12). Beyond thie nothing ia known of Iccius. Mnch has been aeid about
his being anticione, and it vin be found that that is the opinion of the author of his life
in the Biographical Dictionavy usually referred ιο in thece notes· who says, that both· ιιι
thia ode and the epiatle‘ ‘Horace reprehende pointedly but delicately' ιιι Iccius an inor·
dinete desire for weelthfl 1 do not think thia idea would have presented iteelf ιο eo
many minda if the Scholiasta hed not made euch remarks aa these· . “Ad Iccium ata-ibit
quem miratur philosophiae intermisso studio repente ce ad militen-em vitam contulisse
cupiditate divinarumfl—‘0 Pei-simoniam iaudat cum mordacitate '' (Aaou). ‘⁴ Per qnod
videtur concupiscere divitiae Arabum.”--“ Inconstantiae reprehendit qui per avaritiam
philosophiae studium militia mutavit ” (Porphyrion). Such remarks prove nothing and
throw no light upon Horece's meaning, of which we must Judge for oux-selva. The
point ia not worth &cu-dna ae respectu the unknown Iccium but the character of the
ode ia loct in thia view of it. It ie a piece of good-tempeted jocuiar imny, of which the
point lies in the man of books going forth ae a conqueror ιο subdue flerce net-iona nntamed
before, end ιο return leden with the spoils of the Eest. Iccius may heve been of a resne-³
character and net easily eatisfied with his position, if we may judge by the lniguage οι·
the epietle3 hut that ocatcely affecte the spirit of thia ode, in which there doec not appear
to be any thing nel-ioue expres-ed οι· intended. Later times have seen young and chinum
men haatening ιο an El Dorado in expectation of weelth and distinction, and finding
nothing but disappointment, and such appears ιο have been the case on the occasion of
thia expedition into Arabia.
