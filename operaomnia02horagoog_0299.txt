HORATII FLAGGI

ARGUMENT.

Happy is the man who livet on his farm remoto from the troubles of the city end the
dangersofwarandofthesea. Hominshhvinoe‚orwatcheshisfiocks,or graflahis
trees, or stores his honey‚ or shears his sheep, or brings offen-inge of fruit to Priapus
and Silvanus, or lies in the shade or on the eost grans where birds are singing and
streame are murmuringg or hunte the boar, ox· loy· nete for the birds and hares, and
herein foi-gete the pange of love. Givo me a obusto wife who shall cere for my home
and children, milk my goats, prepare my unbought moal, and no dainfiee shall plenae
me like my country fare, as 1 sit and watch the kine and oxen and labourers coming
home to their rest at even. So said Alphiue the usui-er, and determining to live in
the country he got in all his money, but soon repented, and put it out to usury again.

BEATUS ille qui procul negotii8‚
Ut prisea gens mortalium,
Paterna rura bobus exercet suis,

Solutus omni fenore,

Neque excitatur classico miles truci, 5 ’
Neque horret iratum mare,
Forumque vitat et superba civium

Potentiorum limina.

Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine

Altas maritat populosi,

10

Aut in reducta valle mugientium
Prospectat errantes gregeS,
Inutilesque falce ramos amputans

Feliciores inserit,

Aut pressa puris mella condit amphoris,

15

Aut tondet infirmas oves;

Vel cum decorum mitibus pomis caput
Auctumnus agris extulit,

Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pira,

Certantem et uvam purpurae,

4. Solum omni fenora] Torrentius,
whom Orelli followS, explains this ⁴ qui
neque &iz-neque accipit felnoriss end tgna
’ἐξ ἓωΜῬ affimat, mmm}
suit any other n, and would mean that
in the country he would not be subject to
the calls of creditore, and need not get into
debt. The fact is there are some ports of

the language that do and some that do not
nuit the character of Alphius. See Intr.

9. Erqo] This is an adverb of empha-
sis, like δὴ, the use of which it is not easy

to define. Here it expresses a feeling of
pleneme in the contemplation of the soenes

described. In the occupatione and amuse-
mente that follow no particular order of

20

senone is οἶκοι-πᾶ, but one iecroefion after
another is mentioned as it occure, which in a
more poetical way of proceeding than some
editors would adopt, who have altered the
ment of the verses to mit tho meone.
16. infirmas] An ornament-1 epithet, not
‘sickly,’ as Baxter thinks. His note viu
amnne the render :- “ Rustici detondent
aegrotantium ovium clunes eum ob insueta
pabula fluore ventris tentantur, quod non
viderunt interpretes. Occurrit etiam apud
Vet. Schol.” ΤΙιο ατί-,11 of the latter as-
set-tion is doubtful. 1 cannot find my such
notion in the Scholiasta.
17. Vel eum] The commeniators quote
Aen. xi. 4⁰6: ‘⁸ Vel cum ee pavidum con-
tra mea jurgia Μεθ’ etc„ and wama-³·
