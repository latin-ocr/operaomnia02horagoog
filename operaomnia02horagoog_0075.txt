1. Vile potabis modieis Sabinum Can-
thuris] It has been said before thet Sabine
wine was none of the worst· but it wne
&hm ffssmoe‘ &32:2⁰3 mhqtfffflbiss
had not hed the benefit of keep ping. Horace
commend· it therefore by referring to the
circumstances under which it wne bottled.
(I use that term for the process diffundentis
or condendi for went of e better.) If it
was made on hia own ferm, which Maece-
nas gave him, this would enhance the com-
pliment, which would be increaeed by his
having done it with hie own hand. J ιιιιι (a

scholar, bnt unwise commentator) -

thinks on the other hand Horace meant to
give hie friend e hint to bring some better
wine with bium—The meet ordinary kind of
eerthenwore 'ug was cnued ‘’canthur-ue
fflffiss ..mo ¹3⁸ss55032¹132¹2332⁶23
pntting it into a ‘testa’ or ‘emphornf
which hed contained some of the rich wine
oftheAegeenn. (θεοῦ. i. 9. 7, ιι.)

5. Care Maecenas equom] Bentley, on
the authority of one MS. of the Royal
Society, edite⁴ clare' for‘ care. ⁹ He admits
that‘ cere' is consistent with the ocmeion
and the familiar friendehip between Maece-
nas and Horace (C. ιι pm 7). Bnt he
thinke‘ eques' wnnte en epithet· beeidee
Mart. (vi 58) hae,

‘⁸ Sospite bigne sospes Latiae reveheris ed
ur
Et referes pili praemia clarus equee.”

But the character of the ode end the great
propendet-enee of authority in the MSS.
lead me to prefer the common reading.
Μαι-διαὶ was not thinking of Horace or
Maecenas, but of his friend Aulus Pudens.
A verbel coincidence, however unconnected
the passages may be in other respecta, ie
always enough to furnieh Bentley withan
argument in support of e favourite theory.
Maecenas was content with the equestrian
rank and would take no higher: hence the
frequent repetition of the title ⁶ eques ⁹ by
Horace end others. (See iii. 16. 20, and
his life in Dict. Biog.)

7. Vaticani Montis imqm] The theatro
must heve been thet of Pompey, which was
opposite to the Veticnn hill on the left
bank of the river, the hill being on the right
or Etruscan bank, which gives propriety to
the worde‘ paterni fluminis ripae! Fen
says he hae obser-ved the echoes of sounds
striking on the saniculam, which was pert
of the Vnticnn hill. The antepenultimam
syllable of Vetioenus in long in Martinl
and Juvenal. On ‘imago’ eee above, C.
12. 3, ιι.

10. Tu biber] The future han here the
earne signification es above, C. 6. 13 7.
1. ⁶ You may drink if you plesse the richer
wines. 1 have none ench! 'ng the
winee here mentioned eee above, C. 9. 7, ιι.
Some of hmbinue’ MSS. had ⁴ Ceecnbnm‚'
which sani says ie ‘ ornatius et concinnius‚'
and Fen adopts it too. The force of Jaui’s
remark is not obvious.
