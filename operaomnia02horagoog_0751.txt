Pieriis tentata modis; ludusque repertus

HORATII FLAGGI

405

Et longorum operum finis. ne forte pudori

Sit tibi Musa lyrae sollers et cantor Apollo,
Natura fieret laudabile carmen an arte
Quaesitum est· ego nec studium sine divite vena

Nec rude quid possit video ingenium3 alterius sic

410

Altera poscit opem res et conjurat amice.
Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam

Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit,
Abstinuit venere et vino; qui Pythia cantat

Tibicen didicit prius extimuitque magistrum.

415

Nec satis est dixisse: ‘⁴ Ego mira poemata pango;
Occupet extremum scabies3 mihi turpe relinqui est
Et quod non didici sane nescire fateri.”

Ut praece, ad merces turbam qui cogit emendae,

Assentatores jubet ad lucrum ire poe'ta

405. Pieriis tentata modis .·] The coun-
try of Pierio lay between Macedonia end
Thessalia, north of the range of Olympus,
end on the coest of the Sinus Thermaicus.
This accounts for the Muses being both
Pierian end Olym ian. Miiller (p. 27) ceys
thet the Pieriam 'ved up to the time of the
Dorio end Aeolio migratione· ιιι Boeotia end
Phocis, near the mountain rangee of Heli-
con in the former nnd Parnassus in the lat-
ter. Whence he supposes thet to the Pie·
riensistobeoeecedtheerigin ofGreek
poetry, end thet to thie ie to be attributed
the essodntion of the Muses with Helicon
end Parnassus. He thus eleo accounts for
the traditione which assigned the birth of
poetry to bei-ds of Thrace (v. 400, n.), a.
country of which the lenguage was pro-
nounced bei-berone by the civilized Greeks·
for· ⁴when the Pici-iens were preseed in their
own territory by the early Macedonian
princes, some of them crossed the Strym‘on
intoThreeep proper’ '.(Herod vii. 112).ι ⁴It
is however quite conceivable (Miiller adds,
and perhaps he had better have been con-
tent with this) that in early times, on nc-
count of their close vicinity, or because all
the north wan comprehended under one
neme, the Pieriam might in Seuthem
Greece heve been called Thi-aciens. These
Pierians, from the intellectuel relations
which they maintained with the Greeks,
appear to be a Grecian rece, which snp-
poeition ie eleo confirmed by the Greek
names of their places, rivere, founteins.

&c.” Further observatiam will be found in

the seme work showing the probable con·

nexion between these Pia-inne end the Epic
poetry of uomet.

406. Et lonyorum operum βαίη] The
ται-81 Dionysia (v. 275, n.), called τὰ κατ’

poue οι· τὰ μικρὰ, took place et the end
⁰¹1⁴ the year, in the mouth Ποσειδέων, when
the laboure of the vintege were oven

408. Natura fleret laudabile] See v.
295, n.

413. Multa tum fecitque paen] ‘ He
takes great peine when he ie young: ‘puer'
being emphatic, es in c.i.9. 16.

414. qui Pythia cantat Tibicen] At
the Pythian gemes therememnzicel con-
test in which ssute- play ers end hnrp- playa-e
took pert, the subject being the contat of
Apollo with the serpent Pytho. The neme
given to thie music wne νόμος nvos ιιι-ὅς.

416. Nec eatis eet diaet'eee .·] An the
editions till Bentley heve ⁴ nunc-⁹ He
edited ⁴ nec' from two MSS„ which heve
since been confirmed by others, and among
them by Orelli'e St. Gallen. I prefer ⁸ nec,'
though the Scholieete certainly had ⁴ nunc,'
end that hee most authority. Comm.
Cruq. explains it ⁴⁴ Setis est nostris poetis
ut dicent,'' which must be the meaning if
⁴ nunc ' is retained.

417. Occupet extremum scabies ,·] The
Scholiaste say thie expression was need by
boys in their recen.
