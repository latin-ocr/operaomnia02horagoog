CARMINUM III. 2.

Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae

141

Intaminatis fulget honoribus,
Nec sumit aut ponit secures

Arbitrio popularis aurae.

Virtus recludens immeritis mori
Caelum negata tentat iter via,
Coetusque volgares et udam
Spernit humum fugiente penna.

Est et fideli tuta silentio

Merces: vetabo qui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae sub isdem
Sit trabibus fragilemve mecum

says Jmi: ³absurdius ’ might have been
better. Livy might have corrected him, who
tells how 500 Numidians fell upon the Ro-
mans, ⁴⁴ tergaque ac poplites caedentes stra-

with it, and ‘ timido⁹ applies to both (see
note on C. i. 2. 1).

17. Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae]
‘Nescia’ seems to mean ‘ unconscious σίζ’
because ⁸ indifferent to ⁹ the disgrace of re-
iection, which, if ' to any, is not
so tn the virtuous, but to those who reject
them. Dillenbr. interprete otherwise, that
the virtuous do not seek honours, aud there-
fore do not know the discredit of defeat, · but
that is contrary to fact, and therefore not
likely to be Horace' s meaning

18. Imminutio] This word, not being
found elsewhere, has been much discussed.
Like ‘contaminatus,⁹ ‘attaminatusss it is
derived from the obsolete word ‘ tamino,⁹
and contains the root ‘’tag of ‘Q’ as

‘integer' does. ‘In- contaminatis' is the
reading of a few MSS. Η. Stephens (Diat.
ii. l) says, “Ex quamplurimis manu-
scriptis exemplaribus afferri videmus⁴ incon-
taminatis? 'which is simply au invention,
if the otlier editors are not all false. Cru-

quius adopts it in his text (Orelli says‘ ‘e
Codd.,' 'but I think he is mistaken, for Cru-

notices none in his commentary, where
he has‘ intaminatis ⁹,) and his Scholiast had
the same reading. ΤῙιε other Scholiasta had
⁴ intaminatis,' which is the reading of all the
editions 1 have seen, except those of Cunning-
ham aud Sauadon. Lambinus and Bentley
edit this, bnt prefer the other; but the latter
sufficiently answers his own and the only

Horace, Cicero, and others, which, through

the loss of so many writers, we find no
where else. ’⁹'

20. Arbitrio popularis aurae. ] This word
which plainly means that the popular judg-
ment ιε lilte a shifting breeze, setting now
this way, now that, appears in Vis-gil (Aen.
vi. 817)· -

“Nimium gaudens popularibus auns,”
and ιιι Lucan (i. 132) :—

“ Totus popularibus auris
Impelli plausuque sui gaudere thaan-if

Compare for the sentimenta C. iv. 9. 39, sqq.

25. Est etfideli tuta cilentio] Simonides,
in the same poem (Bergk says, p. 767) from
which the former quotation comes (v. 14, n),

³⁸5⁹·-
ὲστὶ καὶ σιγᾶς ἀκίνδυνον γέρας,

which words it appears Augustus was ac-
quainted with and approved. When Atheno-
dorus was about to leave his camp he em-
braced the emperor and said, “O Caesar,
whenever thou art wroth, say nothing, do
nothing, till thou hest gone over in thy
mind the twenty· ·four letters of the alpha-
bet! '⁹ Whereupou the emperor took him
by the hand and ssid,‘ ⁶1 have need of thee
stills 'and he detained him a whole year,
saying, “Silence too hath its safe rewardst
