Mox etiam agrestes Satyros nudavit, et asper ⁰
Incolumi gravitate jocum tentavit, eo quod
Illecebris erat et grata novitate morandus
Spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.

Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces

Conveniet Satyros, ita vertere seria lud0,

Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur heros,
Regali conspectus in auro nuper et estre,
Migret in obscuras humili sermone tabernas,

Aut dum vitat humum nubes et inania captet.

Ut festis matrona moveri jussa diebuS,
Intererit Satyris paulum pudibunda protervis.

choral songs or dithyrambs to which the
name τραγῳδία first belonged. Bentley
(Phal. p. 161) supposes the name to have
been derived from the prize, but denies that
it existed before the time of Tbespis. (See
below, v. 275, n. The chorus appeared in
the character o Satyrs as attendants on
Dionysus, at whose festival they performed.
Their subjecte were originally confined to
the adventures, serious and sportive‚ of that
god, and therefore were a mixture of mirth
and gravity. Choerilus, an older contem-

Drama, the entire separation of which from
tragedy, as we now understand the word,
was effected a few years later by Pratinas of
Phlius iu Argolis, about mc. 600: thence-
forward it was usual for the trag-ic poeta to
exhibit four‘ plays at a time (teti-alogia), of
which the fourth was a Satync Drama, such
as the Cyclops of Euripides. The following
remarks will explain most of this passage 2-—
“ The Satyric Drama was not a comedy,
bnt a playful tragedy. Its subjecte were
taken from the same class of adventures of
Bacchus and the heroes as tragedy; but
they were so &ested in connexion with rude
objects of outward nature thet the presence
and participationi of rustic petulant Satyrs
seemed quite appropriate. Accordingly all
soenes from free untamed nature, adven-
tures of a striking character, where sti-ange
monsters or savage tyrants of mythology
are overcome by valour or etr-stagera, belong
tothis class; and in such seenesas these
the Satyrs could express various feeling-s of

terror and delight, diegust and desire, with
all the openness and unreserve which belong
ιο their character. An mythical subjecta
and characters were not therefore mited to
the Satyric Drama. The character but
suited to it 'seems ιο bave been the power-ful
hero Hercules, an ester and drinker and
boon communion, who, when he is in

humour, allows himself to be amuaed by
the pet-uiant sporta of Sat-yn and other
similar elves ’⁹ (Miiller, p. 29⁴, sq.).

224. potus et calca] This expresses the
freedom which attended the Dionysiae fes·
tivals aster the sacrifices vere over.

228. auro nuper et ostrea ⁸ He who
but now came foi-ward in gold and purple
(which ornaments gods and heroes wore,
see above. v. 215, n.)‚ let him not pass into
low lauguage as if he were a frequente of
merus: -- which were commonly vauls
under ground, and are therefore called
‘ obscuras?

230. nuber et {notia captet] Compare
Persius (v. 7); ‘⁸ Grande locuturi nebulas
Helicone legunto.” Aa to the construction
with ‘indigna’ inthe nextverse see C. iii.

234. dominantia nentina solun Verba-
que‚] As ιο ‘nomina verbaque' see S. i.
3. 103, n. ‘Dominantia nomina’ is an
adaptation of the Greek εΰρια ὀνόματος
that is, literal words as opposed to figuran-
tive. Horace says he shall not confine
himself to these if he ever takes to writing
Satyric Drama-s. As to ⁴ differre ³¹ with the
dative see S. i. 4. 48, n.
