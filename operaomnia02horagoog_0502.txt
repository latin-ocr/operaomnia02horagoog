SATIRARUM II. 3.

Latus ut in Circo spatiere et aeneus ut stes,
Nudus agris, nudus nummis, insane, paternis;

Scilicet ut plausus quos fert Agrippa feras tu,

Ne quis humasse velit Ajacem, Atrida, vetas cur?

Circus, and have a bronze statue voted you
-that is to say, that you may be loaded
with the same honours as the great Agrippa,
like a fox aping a lion) It was customary
for the aediles to distribute grain or vege-
tables of the sort mentioned ω the common
people at the festival of the Floralia (Comm.
Cruq.). See Persius (v. 177)=

‘⁸ — vigila, et cicer ingere large
Rixanti populo, nostra ut Floralia possint
Aprici meminisse senes.''

Agrippa, aster he had been praetor and
consul, undertook the aedileship, which was
the lowest of the curule offloes, in Α.ιι.ο.
721, to gratify Augustus. His munificence

splendid scale, and large donations to the
people. ⁶ Intus spatiere ⁹ is explained in
the note on Epod. iv. 7. Such statues as
are here supposed were usually erected in
the Forum, and one had probably been
lately placed there in honour of Agrippa.
It may be observed that Oppidius plainly
means the first part of his address, from
⁸ In cicere,' δια, to apply to ,ὡς careless

Tiberius, who, if he spends his money, will
look sor a substantial return for it in such
honours and rewards as he saw Agrippa had
won. The old editions till Lambinus had
‘laetus3' ‘latus’is the reading of all the
MSS. The greater number of MSS. are in
favour of ⁴ aut aeneus,' and that is the
reading of all the editions till Bentley, who
adopts that of some good MSS„ ⁸ et senen&
saying that this word is never used as a
trisyllable. 1 do not see that the disjunc-
tive particle is wanted, as some editors
affirm. As to ‘aeneus’ see C. iii. 3. 66, n.
The form of exp
like that in C. iv. l. 192 “Albanos prope
te lacus Ponet marmoream ;” and Virg-
(Ec. vii. 35)=

‘⁴ Nun? tt: marmoreum pro tempore fecimusg
a

Si fetura gregem suppleverit aureus esto.”

The saine way of speaking is common in
Greek. ‘ Astuta ingenuum,' &a appears to

be nothing but a suitable illustratiou in-
vented by Horace. It is obvious enough,
and we need not suppose it a proverb or a
current fable of Aesop or any one else.

187. Ne quis humasse velit] This scene
is taken from the remensa-auce of Ulysses
with Agamemnon in the Ajax of Sophocles
(v. 1328, sqq.). ⁶ Veto ' usually governs the
infinitive mood. Once more, as here, Ho-
race uses it with ‘ne ’ and the subjunctive
(Epp. ii. l. 239): “Edicto vetuit ne quis
se praeter Apellem Pingeret ;'’ and once
with the subjunctive, but without ‘ ne ⁹
(C. iii. 2. 26)=

‘⁶ vetabo ui Cereris sacrum
Vulgarit arcanae sub is em
Sit trabibus, fragilemve mecum
Solvet phaselon.''

Tibullus has ‘veto’ with ‘ut ε’ “Illius ut
verbis sis mihi lenta veto ” (ii. 6. 36).
‘ Atrida ' is the later form of the vocative.
The Greek ‘Atride' is used in Epp. i. 7.
43. The termination of Anchisa in Aen.
iii. 475: “ conjugio Anchisa Veneris dignate
superbo,” on which Servius quotes Horace’s
⁸ Atrida,’ is Greek, being the Doric a sor η.
‘ Cur ' is awkwardly placed, as it is in S. 7.

 

104. The connexion with what precedes lies
in the extravagant and imperious conduct of
the king as illustr-ating the excesses of pride,
and proving that madness is found in high
places and in the beart of kings. Stertinius,
it must be remembered‚ is exposing the
folly of ambition. The dialogus is supposed
to be between Agamemnon and one of his
soldiers in view of the unburied corpse of
Ajax. ⁶ Nil ultra quaero plebeius ' is inter·
posed by the soldier= ⁴ Ι am a king: (⁸ 1
am one of the common sort, and dare ask no
morel’)—-‘ and moreover the thing is just
that 1 command! There is a good deal of

mon , “gneus ut m , i? irony here. The justice os the command is

secondary to the will of the despot, and his
subject is ready with instinctive awe to
admit that it is so3 but the tyrant con-
descends to justify his act3 and the man of
low degree, not without trembling and
doubt and astonishment at such condescen-
sion, ventures to ask that his reason may be
enlightened a little, in order that he may
learn to acquiesce willingly. Compare J uve-
nal (S. x. 69, sqq )=
