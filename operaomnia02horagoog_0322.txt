of Roman nauticsl terms in order to under-

stand them. They refer, it would appear,

to the desei-tion of Antonius' naval force, as
the foregoing refer ιο his troops. Some of
his ships either did not enter the battle or
quitted it and took shelter in some neigh-
bouring hai-bour. Whether Horace means
to be so precise as ιο say that that hai-bour
lay to the eastward of Actium, as Bentley
supposes, 1 think doubtful, though there

Scholia-*ste and nearly all the old commen-

Antonius and Cleopatra to be meant3 but
it was not known whither Antony had fled
when the messenger came ιο Rome and
this ode was written. 1 believe the mean-
ing of the words, as 1 said, is impenetrably
obscure, from our ignorance of their nau-
tical phrases3 but if any will take ⁸ sinis-

it must be understood that the deserting
ships made their escape from the scene of
action into the gulf, and there remained till
the battle was over. Bentley, without ac-

knowledging that Heinsius had preceded
him with the same notion, supposes⁸ sinis-

no doubt it means. Whether Horace ex-
actly states what he had heard, and whether
the information was precisely correct, we

cannot teu. He wrote while the tidings ⁸

were fresh, and probably gave only popular
reports. The defection of the Galatiam is
mentioned by Plutarch (Ant. 63). Servius
gives the number 2000, but he probably
only copied Horace' s statement. ‘citae’
is the participle οῖ’ cieo.’

aureos currus] Philostratus, in his
lise of Dion, the sophist, says, the Emperor
Trajan used to take him up by his side οιι
the gilded chariot used by conquerors in
their triumphs. The form of the chariot
is described by Zonaras (vii. 21 asthat οἶα

τηρίῳ οὔτε πολεμιστηρίῳ ἦν ἐμφερὲς, ἀλλ’
εἰς πύργου περιφεροῦς τρόπον ἐξείργαστο
(quoted by Turnebus, ii. 16). Four horses,
which on special occasions were white, were
used sor drawing the triumphal char-iot.
Heifers that had not been under the yoke
were offered in sacrifice at the close of the
procession. Scipio Africanus Minor tri-
umphed in a.u.c. 608, and Marius in 650.
25. cui super Kartha-finem] An that
is here said about Scipio's tomb is that his
valom- built him one on the ruins of Car-
thage, which is no more than a repetition
of C. iv. 8. 17. Aoeon‘s story, that the
Romans, by command of the oracle, built a
tomb to Scipio at the mouth of the Tiber
looking towards Carthage, is no doubt a
fabrication3 and Turnebus' note, ⁸⁸ cujus
sepulchro eversae Carthaginis titulus sub·

doubt the conquest of Carthage was, as he
says, “titulo res digna sepulchri ” (J nv vi.
230). Βιιι Horace is speaking of a tomb
of renown, in which Scipio' s memory is
enshrined, not his body. Bentley has a
long note here, the substance of which is
this= ⁸ Africanum ’ may mean either the
elder or younger Scipio; if the elder is
understood, we must suppose that ‘ sepul-
chrum ' means Ennius' poem (see C. iv. 8.
17, ιι.), which was to him a tomb or
monument ‘surpassing Carthago ς’ but if
the younger is meant, then he proposes ιο

He proves that Statius (Sylv. ii. 7) calls
Lucan’s Pharsalia ⁸⁸ Pompeio sepulchrum ;”
and in an epigram in the Anthology, Hec-
tor clnims Homer’s poem as his tomb. No
one can deny that ‘quo super’ may mean
⁶ on behalf of whom,’ and that Carthago
might be called Scipio’s tomb, as Salamis is
Themistocles’ in another epigram. But
why the reading of all the MSS„ which is

difficult ιο tell. It yields a very good
sense.1 think it refers ιο ιιιο younger
Scipio, which gives the most obvious mean-

ing. The reference ιο Ennius' poem would
