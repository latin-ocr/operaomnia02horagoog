timete construction and, supported as it is,
ought to be adopted.

303. Agave] How she end the other
Maenade tore her son Pentheus to pieces
for intruding upon the orgies, is related at
length by Ovid (Met. iii. 701, sqq.) end
other authors referred to in Dict. Myth.
For ⁸ menibus ’ in this verse, the old edi-
tions, with scarcely an exception, have
⁸ demens! The oldest Blandinian MS. had
⁸ manibus,' which Bentley introduced into
the text 011 this authority, confirmed by
three other MSS. in his time, and since by
several mentioned hy Fea. Why ‘ demens'
ever should heve been forged, if ⁶ menibus '
is the true reading, it ia not easy to say.
‘Manibus' may heve been invented from
Euripides, who two or three times speaks
of Agave with her son'a head in her arms
(Bacch. vv. 967, 1137, 1275). These pas-

not proof. ⁴ Portat' expresses all thet is
meent without the addition of ⁴ manibus!
All Orelli's MSS„ which are acme of the
best, heve ⁴ demens! He edits ⁴ manibus. ’
Tho St. Gallen MS. hes ⁴ vel manibus ⁹
superscribed over ⁶ demens!

308. Aedificas, hoe era] ⁴ Yon are
building, which is es much aa te say, you,
who ere a dwarf two feet high, are aping the
aire of a gient3 and yet yon langh at Turbo
(a gladiator of great cour-nge, bnt small
stature, Porph. says), ewelling with a spirit
too big for his little body! Horace may
have been making some additions to his
Sabine house. end about this time Maecenas
built his large house 011 the Esquiline (see
S. i. 8, Introd.). Priscian (p. 683, quoted

by Bentley), distingnishing Turbo, -onis,
from ⁴ turbo,' a whirlwind, says the former
is the name of a gladiator, and quotes this
passage. Turbo is n name found in in-
scriptione.

ῗῗῐιὲξυο νξτίᾬιρέζξε Sim-da gnoeGtugi rign
potuerint alienos occupare.'’ ln the next
verse ‘tentum’ has been restored to the
text on the authority of the oldest Blan-
dinian MS. by Bentley, in whose time the
received reading was ¹ tanto! A similar
construction occurs immediately below (ver.
317), ‘tentum magna,' where ⁴ tandem ⁹ has
got into most MSS. and editions. ‘Mul-
tum similis' (S. ii. δ. 92), ‘multum dissi·
milis' (Ερρ. 1. 10. 3), are like phrases.
⁴ Tanto is the dative governed hy ‘ certare!

314. Absentie ranae] This fable is told
by Phaedrus (i. 24). The render will have
no difficulty in following the narrative of
Horace with the punctuation 1 have given,
which in the main is that of Heindorf end
Orelli. Greet difficulty has been raised by
the little frog's reply, that the ox was only
