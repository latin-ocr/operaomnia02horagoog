The MSS· very. The old editions 1 heve

seen(Ven. 1⁴83, Ameneia, 1519) heve

‘'et the disorder Burrus leboured under,
which was e longing to be thought hund-

more clearly than the other, end the ‘ ut'
repented in two lines reads hereb, es above
in vv. 5, 6. ΤΙιο nderanee of eu-
thority seems ιο be in favour of ‘ ut,’ und

The sense with ‘ut' is, ‘if nny one were
efflicted with the seme disorder ss Barrus,
that he should long ιο be thought hnndsome!

refers to the fine promises of mndidstes for

38. Syri, Damae aut Dionysi] These
were common names of slaves. The prec-
tice of executing criminals by tbi-owing
them from the Tsrpeinn Roek (pert of the
Mons capitolinus) was not common in the
Ister period of the republic.1t was never
applied to slaves, who were put to (leeth
chiefly by crucifixion outside the city on
the Esquiliae. (See Epod. v. 99, ιι.)
‘Cadmus' is said by all the Scholiasta ιο
have been ι public executioner of thet day.
“carnifex notae crudelitatis ” (Acron).
But the carnifex bed nothing to do with
the execution of citizens. There is another
reading, which is adopted by landinus (V en.

40. At Novius] The upstnrt who is
supposed ιο be eddressed in the previous
lines is n plebeiam tribune, and he here
nffirms ssiat if bis birth is low, that of his
collesgu e Novius (who may be any body,
see note on S. 3. 21)· is still lower. Freed-
men end persons following low tudes were
admitted into the tenete und f’rced into
high megisti-ecies by Julius Caesar, nnd it
was not till some years after this Sutire was
written that Augustus purged the senate of
these members. The words ⁶ gradu post
me sedet uno ' are not easily interpreted.
Cruquius' Scholisst explains them of tbe
sourteen first rows nt the thentre which
were assigned to the equiws (Epodjv. 15, n.)

“in quatuordecim gradibus equestris digni-
tatis sedet uno gradu post me.” But there
