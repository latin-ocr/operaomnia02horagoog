Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo ;
Semper ad eventum festinat et in medias res
N on secus ac notas auditorem rapit, et quae

Desperat tractata nitescere posse relinquit3

Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,
Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.
'l'u quid ego et populus mecum desideret audi:
Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis et usque

Sessuri donec cantor ‘ Vos plaudite ' dicat,

Aetatis cujusque notandi· sunt tibi mores,
Mobilibusque decor naturis dandus et annis. ·
Reddere qui voces jam scit puer et pede certo
Signat humum, gestit paribus colludere, et iram

Colligit ac ponit temere, et mutatur in horas.

Imberbus juvenis tandem custode remoto

Gaudet equis canibusque et aprici gramine campi,
Cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus asper,
Utilium tardus provisor, prodigus aeris,

death. But as this was before the Trojan
war, and had nothing to do with it, to begin
an account of Diomed's return with an ac-
count of his uncle’s death would be absurd
enough. It would seem as if some poet
had been guilty of this absurdity. The
Scholiasts say it was Antimachus. (See
note on v. 136.)

147. femine—ab oum] That is, from
the birth of Helen, who was born from one
of the egge brought forth by Leda, while
Castor and Pollux issued from the other.
(See S. ii. 1. 26, “ovo prognatus eodem.”)
This introductory matter was handled in
the poem of Stasinus before mentioned, of
which the following fragment has been pre·
sei-ved ιιι Athenaeus (viii. 10)·

τοῖς ἓξ, μετὰ τριτάτην Ἑλένην τέκε, θαῦμα
eroice,

τήν ποτε καλλίκομος Νέμεσις φιλότητι
Ζηνίμιέεειὶἶνα βασιλῆι, τέκε κρατερῆς ὑπ’
ἀνάγκης.

148. in mediae ret] The ancients appear
particularly to have remarked this quality
of Homer's poems. See Quintil. vii. 10.
11 ε “ ubi ab initiis inci iendum, ubi more
Homerico e mediis vel timis ?’'

151. Atque ita mentitur, εἰσ veris]
⁸⁴ ⁸ Ita,' ⁴ so ⁹ (the oldest form of the neuter
fssnfsgniw’.Pffsfrffigsgffifgffess
the demonstrative ‘ ho,' ‘thia' ” ‘ Ita’
therefore ia the usual word with ⁴ ut ’ fol-

lowing. But the poets (and sometimes even
the prose writers) use ⁴ sic ’ in the same
construction, and in others in which ‘ita'
is more usual. See Key’s L. G. 1⁴51, and
compare C. i. 3. l, “Sic te Diva potens
Cypri? and Epp. i. 7. 69, “Sic ignovisse
ιιίιιιίῡο.η
p 154. aulaea manentis] See Epp. ii. 1.
189. Ῑιι the next verse ‘'cantor is used
for the actor, as Cicero uses it (Pro Sest.c
55)·ι . ‘Sedebat exanimatus: et is qui antea
cantorum convicio contiones celebrare suas
solebat cantorum ipsorum vocibus ejicieba-
tur.” He is speaking of Clodius, at whom
as he sat in the theatro tho actore pointed
some words from the comedy that was being
performed. (See Forcellini.) ⁴ Vos plau-
dite ’ were the words with which a play
usually concluded.

157. flebilibusque decor naturis] Bent-
ley, on very little authority, edite ⁴ maturis!
Horace means that men’s characters shifls
and change with the different stages of lite,
and that these changes must be attended
to. He goes on to explain them in a clear
and elegant manner.

161. custode remoto]
‘paedagogus,' as in S. i. 6. 81, where see
note. This person's functione ceased when
the boy assumed the ‘ toga virilis! ⁴ Campi,'
as elsewhere, means the Campus Martius.
The characteristica of youth aud age here
given are nearly the same as in Aristone
(Rhet. ιι. 12, sq.). ‘Sublimis cupidusque’
means⁴ soaring and ambitione!

This means the
