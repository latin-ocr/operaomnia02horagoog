EPISTOLARUM Ι. 7.

Qnmuun dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum,

Sextilem totum mendax desideror. Atqui

Si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,

Quam mihi das aegro dabis aegrotare timenti,

Maecenas, veniam, dum ficus prima calorque 5
Designatorem decorat lictoribus atria

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,

officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis

Adducit febres et testamenta resignat.

Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
Contractusque leget3 te, dulcis amice, reviset
Gum ZephyriS, si conceda, et hirundine prima.
Non quo more piris vesci Calaber jubet hospes

Tu me fecisti locupletem.

l. Quinque dies] This is a conventional
phrase to express any short time. It occurs
ῗιι S.1.3. 16, “quinque diebus Nil ιιι-αι’ ιιι
οσιι11ιι.”

who arranged the processioa at the funeral
of any important phi-son, and the⁸ lictores'
were his attendants who kept order (see S.
i. 6. 43). 1 do not imagine that⁸ lictoribus
atris’ means any thing bere but the common
attendants of the undet-taken but it would
seem that the ⁸ lictores' and other officere
who attended οιι the magistrates were
sometimes appointed to attend the‘ de·
signator' οιι these occasions. Cicero (de
Legg. ii. 24. 61), referring ιο the XII.
Tables, say s, “Reli uain more sunt· funus
ut indicatur, si quid ludorum3 dominusque

which name belonged also to the person
who put people of rank in their places at

It does not seem as if the diminutive form

uses diminutives when it suits the mensure.
10. Quodsi bruma nives Albanis] ⁸Si'
is used with reference to a future event,
even if it be not hypothetica, when any

14. Calaber jubet bomem] The man is

cause the Calabrians were‘ ‘politioris vitae

and the former does not belong exclusively
to conventional retinement, which· is rather
apt ιο corrupt it. The guent· ιι polite enough,
