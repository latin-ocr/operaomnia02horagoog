SATIRARUM Ι. 3.

353

Nobiscum vivit, multum demissus homo : illi

Turdo cognomen pingui damus.

Hic fugit omnes

Insidias nullique malo latus obdit apertum,

Cum genus hoc inter vitae versetur ubi acris

60

Invidia atque vigent ubi crimina, pro bene sano
Ac non incauto fictum astutumque vocamus.
Simplicior quis et est, qualem me saepe libenter
Obtulerim tibi, Maecenas, ut forte legentem

Aut tacitum impellat quovis sermone molestus,
Communi sensu plane caret, inquimus.

Eheu,

Quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam l

Nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur-3

optimus ille est

Qui minimis urgetur. Amicus dulcis ut aequum est

doubt οἰ its belong-ing to the latter, sud it
strengthens the common interpretation—
‘s very abject men! Compare v. 147 of
this Satire, ⁴⁴ multum celer etque fidelis.”
44 Multum similis metuenti ” (S. ii. 5. 92).
Lambinus, with some authority, inserts
⁴ est ' before ⁴ demissus! It does not appear
in the best MSS„ bnt is understood. Hein-
dorf’s interpretation of ⁴ et’ after ⁴ pingui’
is unsuthorized end swkwsrd. The dative
ἰ’ἐὶἒεῗᾶαῗιιξῗπθῗιὶῗ. ‘}?“2{‹}¹7¹3¹.¹‘² ῗῖεῗὲῗιῗὲ
common construction, in prose ss well ss
poeti-y, to put the nsme in the dative.
Cicero (in Verr. ii. 4. 53) has “cui no-
men Arethusa est;'' but there Pr0fessor
Key (L. G. 984, note) thinks ⁴⁴ we should
probably read Arethusam, i. e. Arethusae
est.'' This seems to imply that the other
construction would be wrong, but it is used
sometimes. Some MSS. hsve ⁴ pinguis ’ in

the text.

59. malo] This is msscuhne: he lays
himself open to no malignant person, gives
him no handle. ⁴ Hoc ' is like ⁴horum ho-
minum ’ (v. 30).Bent1ey adopts and de·
sends ‘versemur,' the reading of the oldest
Blandinisn Ms. But the other is st least
ss good s reading, sud better supported. 1
believe the above MS. is the only one that
has ⁴ versemur) In connexion with whst
follows, the commentatore quote Livy (xxii.
89): 44 Pro cunctatore segnem pro cnuto
timidum, effingens vicine virtutibus vitia,
compellabat.” By ⁴ simplicior ⁹ Horace
means ⁴ unsophisticeted :’ one who in the
simplicity of his feelings may perhaps some-
times obtrude himself upon those he likes,
thinking he must be welcome because heis

himself plessed to meet them. He ssys he

has often acted in that wey with Maecenas.
This Setire therefore wss not written very
early in their acquaintance.

63. Simplicior quis et θεὴ] See Intro-
duction.

65. impellat] Forcellini gives no other
instance of ⁴ impellere ' in the sense of ⁴ in-
terpellnre,' but gives it that sense here.
Lambinus reads ⁴ appellet ;' Cruquius ⁴ sp-
pellem ;' Bentley conjectures ⁴ impedist,' st
the seme time calling Lambinus’ conjecture
ingenious sud learned. The Scholiast’s
interpretation is ‘interpellet ς’ the reading
of every MS. is ⁴ impellat& snd I do not
feel inclined to sdopt Bentley’s emendation
or his explanation of the received reading,
which, for the benefit of those who hsve
more scruple than himself in deserting the
MSS„ he tells us must mean nudging your
friend with your elbow, or pushing him, to
drew his attention. The instrument is
plainly not ⁴ cubito ⁹ or 4 manu,’ ss be
su , but ‘ sermone,’ and the meaning
is thst he breaks in upon one when reading
or meditating with some irrelevant talk.
Some MSS. says Fen beve ⁴ modestus!
He does not name them. He seperstes
⁴ molestus ’ from the preoeding words, and
reads ⁴⁴ Molestus! Communi sensu plsne
caret, inquimns.” ‘Common sense,’ for
which the Greeks hed the expression ὁ κοινὸς
νοῦς, is so called, not ss being exercised
upon common every-day things, but ss being
supposed to be common property, end not
confined to the learned.

67. quem sancimus] ⁴ Ssncire legem’
is properly to give full effect to s law by
inserting s penalty for the bresch of it.
See Cic. de Am. c. 132 44 Haec igitur prims
lex amicitiae κατείπω-θ’ .
