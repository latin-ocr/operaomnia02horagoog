376 HORATII FLAOOI

seventeen days aster Horacehad lest Rome. The route theytookwas nottheshortest
or the easiest, which lay through Venusia and Tarentum. They preferred taking the
north-eastern road which strikes aoeoss the country from Beneventum, and, reaching the
coast at Barium, continues along the shore till it comes to Brundusium. They were
evidently not pressed for time, and probably took the road they did because it passed
through Canusium, whither one of the party was bound. Maecenas made his journey as
agreeable as under the circumstances it could be, by taking with him such companiousg
and they all appear to great advantage in Horace's good-humoured diary. There was no
restraint between the pah-on and his friends, aud their affection sor him aud one another
it is very pleasant to contemplate.

Since if the occasion above supposed be that on which the mission was sent, they could
not have met Antonius at Brundusium, their journey could not have ended there:
Maecenas at least, and his official companium, must have gone on to Tarentum. whether
Horace accompanied them is uncertain. 1 think probably he did not3 but that Maecenas,
hearing that Antonius had come to Brundusium, and passed on to Tarentum, made all
huto to resch that place. 1 think it likely, however, that Horace took the oppor-
tunity of his return to Rome to visit his native town and its neighbourhood. Kirchnoe
(Qu. Hor. p. 39, sq.) thinks that it was on this ocoesiou he wrote the ode to Archytas
(i. 28), and that to the fountain of Bandusia (iii. 1³); that he visited Septimius (C. ii. 6),
and re‘newed his acquaintance with Ofella (S. ii. 2). Probably Horace took more thau
one journey to Tarentum, with which when he wrote his ode to Septimius he appears to
bave had very pleasant associatione. He seems to have had in mind, as the Scholiasta
say, the desa-iption by Lucilius of a journey he took ιο Capua, of which three or four
verses only have been preserved (see note on v. 6).
