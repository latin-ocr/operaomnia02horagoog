346 HORATII FLAOOI

SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

Horace appears to heve brought enemies upon himself by the last Satire, and perhaps
by others, which have not been puhlished. His emiable temper wss not very well quali·
fied sor that sort of writing, and we may infer from the msent poem that he wished to
clear himself from the imputetion of a censorious spirit, and so to set himself right with
Maecenas and his friends. The connexion between the two Satires is seen in the opening
of this, in which Tigellius is again introduced and the peculiarifies of his character de-
scribed, for no other reason, as it would seem, but to serve ss s text for the discourse
that follows, on the duty of judging others charitebly ss we wish to be judged our-
selves. In the course of his remarks on this subject Horace comes across two of the
Stoic absurditieae one that all faults are nlike (v. 96. sqq.), which he meets hy the
Epicurean absurdity that expediency is the foundation of right ; and the other that every
wise man (thetis, every Stoic) is endowed with sll the gifts of art sud fortune from the
skill of tho mechanic to the power of a king. With a jest upon this folly the Satire
closes.

The character of Tigellius is happily desoeibed (“ Not one, but sll mankind's epitome ”),
and a tone of good feeling runs throughout the Satin-e. The lenguage is genisl, snd
the sentimenta amisble. The style is Horace's own, as we may suppose. Thst of
Lucilius, it is clear, was more ester the fashion of the second Satire, in which his
freedom of speech and licentious language appear to me to be aimed st without the
power which he possessed of giving them point and severity. No one who reads this
Satire would wish to see Horace in the ‹lisguise of the other.

If there is between the two the connexion above supposed, the third Setis-e must have
been written at no great distance of time aster the other. But it appears from v· 63
that he wss now well scquainted with Maecenas, though not on the terms of intimscy
which astes-werde grew up between them. On these grounds it seems probable that the
Satire wss written sbout the end of Α.υ.ο. 716, as Kirchner supposes.

ARGUMENT.

Singers have all one fault—that they will never sing to their friends when they are asked,
end never leuve off when they ere not. This wss the cese with Tigellius, the most
inconsistent manin the world. Caesar himself could not induce him to sing unless
he chose; when the fit was on him he would keep it up from the first course to the
dessertg one moment in a hun-y, another absurdly slowg now with 20⁰ slaves, now
with but ωας one while talking big, another sll humility3 one while content with a
little, another squandering millious; up all night, snoring all day.

But what, have you no faults? Yes, but perhaps not so bed as his. And yet 1 sm
not like Maenius, who, while he exposed his neighbour's faults, coolly declax-ed he
mede excuses for his own. Why should a man be blind to his own defects end have
an engle's eye for his fellows'? He may presently find them turning the tables upon
him. Your friend we will say is a little hasty, sud sensitive, und perhaps not very
polished; but he is s good man. sud kind to you, and a man of genius withal. In
short, examine yourself, and see what faults nsture or neglect has sown in your own
breast before you pass judgment ou others.

Lot us think of this, how the lover overlooks or even loves the deformities of his mistress.
