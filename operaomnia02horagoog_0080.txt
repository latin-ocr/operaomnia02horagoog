CARMINUM 1. 23, 24. 55

Adventus foliis seu virides rubum
Dimovere lacertae,
Et eorde et genibus tremit.
Atqui non ego te tigris ut aspera
Gaetulusve leo frangere persequor: ’ ιο
Tandem desine matrem
Tempestiva sequi viro.

CARMEN XXIV.

A.n.c. 730.

lei-ome, in hle edition of the Chronielee of Eusebius, pleoee the death of Quinctilius
Varus, the subject of this ode, in the first year of the leeth Olympied, that ie Aac.
730 (Olinton, F. PL). This therefore fixee the dete of the ode. Quinctilius was born at
Cremona, end was a neighbour end friend of virgil, through whom it ie probable Horace
made his acquaintance. He is referred to (according to the anholant who ie probably
right) in the Epiesse to the nsua, ν. 438, eqq„ ee e disoeming critica end the languege
there used shows that he was dead when it wau written. The Seholiest Aaron says, that
nome supposed he was Virgil's brother, which notion erese plainly from the lang-uage
Horace uses iuthis ode. Servius eleo, ou Vir-g.. Ec. v. 20 (in which he mpponed Daphnis
to be meent for thie Quinctilius, whereas thet eelogue wne written about caventem years
before his death, end Daphnis plainly is intended for Caesar), ealle him ⁴ cognatum Virgilii?
But for this tha-e is no urrant.

ARGUMENT.

What bouada nli-all be net to our grief for one sedeur? Teechueemournfuletrein,
Melpomene. Cen ithethet Quinctilius, whose like Modeety‚ J urtice, Fidelity, end ‘stuth
ehnll not behold again, in gone to hie everheting rest? Many ie the good men that
mourne him, but none more truly than thou, Virgil- 'Twas not for this thou didst
eommit him to the eere of Heeven. But in vain thou dost ask him beck. The lyre of
Orpheus eould not bring beck the blood to the ehedowy form which Morem-y heth
gethered into hell. 'Tio hard to beer: but petienee makes that lighter which no
power een change.

Qms desiderio sit pudor aut modus

Tam cari capitis? Praecipe lugubres

CantuS, Melpomene, eui liquidam pater
Vocem cum eithara dedit.
