3. Accurrit] Some of the old edition‘s
have ‘ occurrit) 1 am not aware that it
¹appefars ἰξ1 any modern edition. It is much
ess orci e.

5. Suaviter ut nune. esth] ‘ Pretty well
as times go;’ by which, as Orelli says, he
means nothing at all, not caring what he
answers, but annoyed at the forwardness of
his assailant. ⁴ Cupio omnis quae vis’ is a
common formula of politeness.

6. Cum assectantur .·]
pause, and they walk side by side a little

ll. Ο te, Bolane, cerebri Felicem Ι]
The meaning of ⁸ cerebri’ is seen in the
adjective ‘ cerebrosus ¹ noticed above (5.
21); and guided by the words of Horace,
no doubt, Comm. Cruq. tells us that Bo-
lanus was ὀξύχολος, one who, ‘nullius in-
eptias ferebat,' put up with no man’s non-
sense‚—a temper which, under such circum-
stances, the amiable Horace might very well
envy. But he was too well-breti to say
what he felt aloud. Bolanus was a cog
nomen of one at least of the families at

Thereisa

way perhaps, in silence. Horace sees the
man means to begin, and anticipates him
(⁴ occupat') with a civil question tanta-
mount to wishing him good morning, by
which however the other is not discon-
certed. “Surely you know met I'm a
man of letters;'’ at which Horace, who is
too good-natured to bc a match for such a
fellow, is thrown off his guard and returns
him a polite answer. The man has gained
his advantage and goes on chattering about
nothing3 while Horace feels his wealmess
and is driven to common-place expedients
for effecting his escape, at which his com-
panion no doubt laughs in ·his sleeve.
‘ Numquid vis quin abeam ?’ ‘is there any·
thing else 1 can do for you before I go ?”
Prof. Key (L. G. 1183) quotes this phrase
from Terence (Ad. ii. 2. 39), and adds in a
note, “This or a shorter form, ‘ numquid
vis ?’ was a civil mode of saying good-bye.”

10. Dicere nescio quid φαεν-ω] When
the Romans walked abroad even for a stroll
on the most ordinary occasions, they had
one or more slaves with them. They were
a particular class in the ‘ familia,' and called
from their occupation ‘pedisequi.’

Rome. Vettius Bolanus was appointed
governor of Britain in the last year of
Nero's reign (Tac. Ann- xv. 3), and Cicero
had a friend of the same name. It was
derived from Bola, a town of the Aequi.
Francis’ translation,—

’ἦ Bolanus happy in a simil
Of proof, impenetrably duu,”

seems to me quite beside the meaning.

14. Miscere cupis, inquit, abire ,·] Here
the man, feeling his power, puts on all the
familiarity of an intimate friend, and insisoe
upon offering his services and attendance,
and this is bctter expressed by ⁸ persequar ’
than ⁸ prosequar,’ which however has very
good MS. authority, and Bentley adopts it.
The majority of MSS. appear by Fea’s
account to have ‘ uar,’ which means
‘I will follow you to the end! In regard
to the arrangement, the editions vary be·
tween ⁴ uar hinc: quo nunc iter ent
tibi ?' ⁴ persequar= hinc quo nunc iter est
tibi ?' and ⁴ persequar hinc quo nunc ites-
est tibi‚’ without a question. It appears to
me that the man asks a question, and that
Horace's reply is an evasion of it.
