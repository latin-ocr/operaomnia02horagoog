HORATII FLAOGI

Away with nighs. Beer thy noble destiny, for one half the world shall take ite mmo

hamos parrae recinentis omen

Ducat et praegnans canis aut ab agro
Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino

Fetaque vulpes,

Rumpat et serpens iter institutum 5
Si per obliquum similis sagittae
Terruit mannos ε ego cui timebo

Providus auspex,

Antequam stantes repetat paludes

Imbrium divina avis imminentum‚

Oscinem corvum prece suscitabo

Solis ab ortu.

Sis licet felix ubicunque mavis,
Et memor nostri, Galatea, vivae,

Teque nec laevus vetet ire picus

Nec vaga cornix.

1. parrae] What this bird was, or whe-
ther it is known in these islanda, ie not, 1 be-
lieve, determined. Forcellini gives all that is
known about it from the encients. ⁴ Bevus?
if it is akin to χαροπὸς, ae Forcellini and
othere say, belongs properly to the colour
or ep ce of the eyes. Horace appliee
it to a wolf or e lion (Epod. xvi. 33 , in the
latter ceseimitefing perhaps Home e χαρο·
*troi λέοντες (Odyse. xi. 611). But what
does Homer menn? Etymology doen not
help us, for χαροπὸς, except in a derived
oense, cen only mean ghd-eyed‚ md there
ie nothing in the colour of a wolf or a lion
corresponding to that notion. The wolf is

where Galatea would embark. ‘ Rumpat.'
not ⁸ rumpit,’ es Bentley reads ester
Graeviue' MS„ ie 1 believe the reading
which the sense requires, Bentley appears
to have mistaken the meaning of the pas-
sage. The imege of the snake ehooting
across the rond recells J acob’s prophecy in
respecttohis eon Dan: “Dan shall be a
serpent by the wny3 an uider in the path
that biteth the horse’s beels, so that his rider
shall fau buckwarde '' (Gen. xlix. 17).

13. Sis lieet felix] There is a tender-
