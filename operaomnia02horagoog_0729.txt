HORATII FLAGOI

Vicinas nrbes alit et grave sentit aratrum,
Seu cursum mutavit iniquum frugibus amnis
Doctus iter melius, mortalia facta peribunt,
Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax.

Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque

70

Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usuS,
Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi.
Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella
Quo scribi possent numero monstravit Homerus.

Versibus impariter junctis querimonia primum,

67. Seu cursum mutavit] The Scholiasta
say this refers to the draining of theVelabrum
(S. ii. 3. 229 byAgripp a. But Fea has
shown this to e an error. Τὶιο Velabrum
was drained by Tarquinius Priscus, or who-
ever built the Cloaca Maxima (Livy i. 38),
and was occupied by considerable buildings
before the time of Augustus, among which
was the temple of Fortuna Virilis, built by
Lucullus. Suetonius tells us that Augustus
‘⁶ ad coercendas inundationes alveum 'liberis
laxavit, complet-um olim ruderibus et aedi·
ficiorum prolapsionibus coarctatum⁹ ⁹(c. 80.
To some such work as this Horace probaby
refers, in language a little exaggerated.

68. Doctus iter melina] So it is said
os the river in Epp. i. 14. 293 “rivus si
decidit imber Multa mole docendus aprico
parcere pratoss’

69. Nedum emonam stet honos] This
construction Professor Key explains by
supposing the verb ⁸ existumes ⁹ understood
for the sake of brevity. (L. G. 1228.)

71. ei volet usna] See Epp. ii. 2. 119, n.
Horace uses the words in the next verse
without reference to their technical distinc-
tion. The proper meaning οἳ ‘arbitrium,⁹
as distinguished from ⁴ judicium,’ is given
in the Dictionary of Antiquities (art. ‘hdexl
p. 530, a..) ‘,⁹Jus in one of its senses,
was a rule of law (llipp. i. 16. 41). ‘Nor-
ma,' a carpenter⁹ s or mason 's square, also
described in the above Dictionary. The
deciding, order-ing, and shaping of words
is all that Horace means.

75. Versibus impariter· junctis qucri-
monia] ‘⁹1mpariter is not used elsewhere.
What Horace here calls‘ querimonia⁹ is
ἐλεγεῖα Opnvnreoer'1,‘mourning for the dead!
The oldest writer· ιιι this measure that has
come down to us is Callinus of Ephesus,
who appears to have lived during the greater
part of the seventh century a.c. (See Miiller,
Lit. of Greecc, p. 109.) His poetry, like that
of Tyrtaeus of Attica, was of a martial order.
Archilochus of Paros was nearly contem-
porary with these. He too calls himself

Θερ ἀπε-»ν’ Ενυαλὶοιο” avano: (Fr. l. Bergk).
He lost first his reputation (by running
ῖίἒξῖἒιῷἓὲ them& 13.ὲῇ :3 xri.-
warlike. He also wrote elegias for the dead.
Asius of Samos was contemporary wit-h the
above, and these are no doubt the earliest
writers in the elegiae metro. It was there-
fore of Ionian orig-in, whichever of thoee
poete first employed it. That question
which was not settled in Horace⁹s day is
not likely to be settled now, ‘et adhuc sub
judice lis est! The next elegiae poet in
ord'er of time was Mimnermus, also au
Ionian (concerning whom see Epp. i. 6. 65·

ii. 2. 101, ιι..) Hisverseswere chieflyortho
erotic order, which is referred to in v. 76.

sse political and gnomic elegies of Solon and ⁴

Theognis (some of whose poema were con-
vivial) come next, but Theognis more than
half a century later than solon· and con-
temporary with him, or a little older, was
Xenophanes, the founder of the Eleatic,
school of philosophy, whose verses, as sn·
as we know, were of the symposiac order
without being very conducive to mirth.
The great master of threnetic poeti-y was
Simonides of Ceos, the contemporary and
rival of Aeschylus. “ The elegy in the
hands of different masters sometimes at-
tained a sotter and mons pathetic, and
sometimes a more manly and robust tone.
Nevertheless there is no reason for dividing
the elegy into different kinds, such as the
military, polincal, symposiac, erotic, thre—
netic, and gnomic, inssmuch as some of
these characters are at times combined· ιιι
the same poem. Thus the elegy wasusually
sung at the symposium, and in most oses
its main subject is political, aster which it
assumes either an amatory, a plaintive,
οι· a sententious tone. At the same time
the elegy always retains its appropriate
character from which it never departs⁹⁹
(Mjiller, Lit. of Graece, p. 125).
