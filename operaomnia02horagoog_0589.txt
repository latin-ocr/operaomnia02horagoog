HORATII FLAOGI

Sincerum est nisi vas quodcunque infundis acescit.

Sperne voluptates, nocet empta dolore voluptas.

Semper avarus eget: certum voto pete finem.
Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis ;
Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni

Majus tormentum. Qui non moderabitur irae

Infectam volet esse dolor quod suaserit et mens,

Dum poenas odio per vim festinat inulto.

Ira furor brevis est: animum rege, qui nisi paret
Imperat; hunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catena.
Fingit equum tenera docilem cervice magister

Ire viam qua monstret eques; venaticus, ex quo

Tempore cervinam pellem latravit in aula,
Militat in silvis catulus. Nunc adhibe puro ο

Pectore verbs, puer, nunc te melioribus offer.
Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem

Testa diu.

Quodsi cessas aut strenuus anteis‚

55. Sper-ne voluptatem] This is part of
the ssme subject. The pursuit of sensusl
plessure is connected with the ursnit of
money, which is wanted for it. e pursuit
of money lesds on to envy, and envy to
’1ιῖἔέιέ so that all these pithy ssyings hang
to er.

58. Invidia Sicuti] Horace probably
alludes to the bun of Phalaris, which, sc-
cording to Cicero, P. Scipio recovered from
Carthago and restored to the Agrigentiniz
‘⁴ ille nobilis taurus quem crudelissimus
omnium tyrannorum Phslaris habuisse dici-
tur, quo vivos supplicii csuss demittere
homines et subjicere fiammsm solebat” (in
Verr. ii. 4. 3³. See also De Off. ii. 26).
But the tyrsnts of Sicily were proverbial.

60. et παι] ‘Mens ⁹ signifies passion,
μένος. ⁶ Exmens ' (formed like ⁶ exspes,’
⁸ excors‚’ and other words) is sug by
H. Stephens (Diatr. p. 118), and ‘amens ' is
put for-ward by Muretus, who said he found
it in one of the vatican MSS. which Fen
does not non'ee.

61. poenae -sertt'nafl ⁴ Hui-ries nster
its revenge! So Horace uses ⁸ properare’
in C. iii. 24. 62, “pecuniam Her-edi pro-
peret ;” and in the next Epistle (v. 28),
“ Hoc studium parvi properemus et smplil'
It is like the Greek σπεύδειν, which takes
nn accusative.

63. hunc tu compesce] In general pre-

cepts emphasis is sometimes given by the
iltbsprtion of the prononn ⁶ tu! See C. i. 9.

“ -- nec dulces amores
Sperne puer neque tu choress.”

64. Κηφᾶ equm] Here he goes beck
to v. 46, “ sapere andeg Incipe.” For to
be wisc he must lesa-n, and put himself in
the hands of those who csn tesch him.

66. venaticus, es· qno] ‘Catulus ¹

tence. The practice os nsining dog! by
means of stuffed animala was. 1 suppose,

76. Quodsi emas aut mensus atteia]
Horace says he cannot wait for the diln-
ton-5, or trouble himself to keep up with
thosewho are in agrest hurryto get ou.
Hemesns he shsll go his own wayin the
pursuit of wisdom, “qussi diest, meo modulo
incedam ” (Ascena). At the same time he
hints that young persons are aptto get on a
little too fsst, and to mist-ke their own
powers and sttsinments. The conclusion
is abrupt, ss Horace's conclusions osten sm.
He gets tired apparently, and rather μοι]
sometimes, and thinks it is time to stop.
