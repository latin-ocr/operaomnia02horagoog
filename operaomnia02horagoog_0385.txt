360⁸ HORATII FLAcc1

SATIRE IV.

Here again Horace is οι peine to defend himself from the charge of 100101010000.
Τ11οι this charge 1100 loudly brought eguinst him is cleu-3 01111 the second Setire of this
book may 11010 gone 0 long wey towards making him 0110111100. But he must heve
written many more pieees 11100 ι11οι, for he 0000110 of ⁶ 1000 scripta. ⁹ (v. 23), ⁸ meos
libellos ’ (v. 71). It is probeble his other Satires were in the 00100 strein 00 ι110 second,
which 0000010 ιο 11010 11000 published 00 0 specimen οἵ the style he here defends, but
which he thought fit ιο abendon, for there ere no other Satires of thet End. Independent
of the above, Horace here shows something of 00 euthor's soreness in respect to the
neglect his 0001110 11οἀ met with, compared with others which he believed to 11010 less
merit; end though he etfflbutes it entirely to the jeelousy and fests of the multitude,
every 10011 apprehending thet he may be οιιο011011 next, it is 01001· ι11οι 110 puts it down in
some mensure to 0 false teste which preferred 0 wordy flowing style to the terseness end
eccurecy of his own. The 000100 of Lucilius were 00011101· in spite 01· the 1000011000 of
their composition, end many defects which 0 depreved teste hed come to regurd 00 merits.
(See note on v. 6.) The virulenee of Lucilius's Satires did 11οι effect Hersee’s genere-
tion, who could efford ιο edmire them, but hsd no liking for verses ι11οι 00100 1101110 ιο
themselves. Horace began his 001001· 00 0 0011111101 writer with Lucilius for his model.
und the second Setire is 0 specimen of the style resulting from thet imitation. It 0οι
uneesily upon him. Lucilius he found, with 011 his power und his mei-its, 1100 11οι the
model for him, end he 1100 probably teunted with coming short of the vigour of his
original, end this perhaps by the persons who were loudest in charging him with 0
indignant temper. He hed therefore to 0οι himself right in respect to Lucilius, 01111 ι1110
110 does both here eud elsewhere (S. 10 end ii. 1) with much good temper, cnndour, sud
sorbent-enee. He 1100 0100 to 000110οι 1110 own pretensious with those of the Crispinuses
end Fanniuses of the dsy, 00 well 00 to quiet the apprehensione of his friends, end disnrm
the melignity os his enemies, and these ure the objects of the Satire- Everybody must
edmire the wey in which he takes 00000100, from the neoeesity of sels-defenee, to puy 0
tribute of grateful affection to his sethei-'s memmy, end it would be difficult to find 0 more
pleesing picture of 00ιο11101 solicitude end sound sense, 00 applied to 0 boy’s 011110οι100,
then Horace 1100 drawn in the latter part of this Satire.

About the dete, Frenke says it must 11010 been written before Α.11.0. 716, when
Asinius Pollio first introduced the practice of regular recitatione of their works by authors.
He says Horace would not 11010 treated the reciters 00 contemptuously if their 01001100
hed come into 1110111011 through the example of 1110 friend Pollio. As 1 heve said on v. 73,
1 do not think the practice alluded to by Horace 1100 any thing to do with Pollio's 0100ιί0ος
end 00 to Fennins’ books end bust having been deposited, 00 some 11010 said, in the
librery built by this 001110 Ρο1110 10 Amne. 715, there is not the remotest 100000 to believe
it. Frenke says Horace could not οι this time heve been on good tei-ms with Augustus,
or he.would not 11010 mentioned ‘⁸ 0001110 irrisione ” Petillius Capitolinus (94, sqq.), 11110
1100 0 friend of his. But the only bitterness 111 Ηοηο0’0 1101·ᾶο 10 111 ι110 sneer which he
puts into the mouth of Petillius’ friend end condemns. In short, the Setire 0000010 ιο
me to contsin no clue to its 110101 11οι 1ι evidently eoneerns Horeee's early reputation,
end so must he pmd early, end not very long 011101· S. 2, which he quotes in v. 92.
