82. Quae qravt'r Aesopum] Claudius
Aesopus, the tragic actor, was an intimate
ffiend of Cicero's, and most of the distin-
guished men of that time. He was older
than Cicero, though the date of his birth is
not known, or that of his death. He was
a freedman of some person belonging to the
Clodia gens. Speaking os enunciation
Quintilian applies the same epithet to
Aesopus that Horace does: “ Plus autem
affectus habeant lentiore: ideoque Roscius
citatior, Aesopus gravior fuit, quod ille
comoedias hic tragoedias egit ’' (xi. 3. 111).
Cicero makes Quintus compare Aesopus’
delivery with his own, and speaks of him as
showing ‘⁸ tantum ardorem vultuum atque
motuum ut eum vis quaedam absh-exisse a
sensu mentis videretur '' (de Div. i. 37).
⁶ Gravis ' is a good epithet for a tragic
actor.

— quae doctus Roscius eyit .·] Q. Ros-
cius, the cor'nic actor, was also an intimate
friend of Cicero, who osten speaks of him,
and pleaded a cause for him in a speech still
in part extant. Cicero speaks of ‘¹ Roscii
gestus et venustas '' (de Orat. l. 59), and
illustrates the description of Quintilian
given above, “ Roscius citatior,” by saying
(de Legg. i. 4) that when he was getting
old ⁴¹ numeros in cantu cecidit ipsasque
tardiores fecit tibias! His enunciation was
rapid when he was young, but he was
obliged to slacken it in his old age. The
meaning of ⁴ doctus ’ can only be explained
of the study he gave to his profession, and

the accurate knowledge he acquimd of the
principles of his art. He died about asne.
692, and was enormously rich, like Aesopus,
whose wedth has been referred to on S. ii.

86. Jam Saliare Numae carmen] ‘Hie
Salii consisted of two colleges of twelve
priests each3 one said to have been esta-
blished by Numa on the Palatino hill to
attend on Mars Gradivus3 the other by
Tullus Hostilius on the Quirinal for the
service of Quirinus. The first were espe-
cially appointed to preserve the ancilia or
shields of Mars which at his festival at the
beginning of March every year they carried
in processiom “ Canentes carmina cnm tri-
pudiis sollemnique saltatu” (Liv. i. m. See
C. iv. l. 28, n.). These hymns were in
honour of Mars (as seems probable), under
the name Mamurius Veturius. The other
gods were also celebrated. The hymns
were called by the name ‘axamentass of
which the etymology is unknown. Their

orum carmina vix sacerdotibus suis satis
intellecta ” (ἰ. 6). But there appear tn
have been those who thought themselves
elever enough to make them out, which
Horace takes leave to doubt. It may be .
that popular belief attributed the compo-
sition of these verses to Numa, though '
that need not be inferred from what Horace
says. Virgil gives the name of Selii to the
priests of Hercules (Aen. viii. 28⁵), and
deam-ibes their hymns in terma apparently
drawn stom the Salii of Mars.
