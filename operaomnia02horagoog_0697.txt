HORATII FLACOI

Munditiae pepulere3 sed in long-um tamen aevum

Manserunt hodieque manent vestigia mris,

150

Serus enim Graecis admovit acumina chartis,
Et post Punica bella quietus quaerere coepit
Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus utile ferrent.
Tentavit quoque rem, si digne vertere posset,

Et placuit sibi, natura sublimis et acer3

165

Nam spirat tragicum satis et feliciter audet,
Sed turpem putat inscite metuitque lituram.
Creditur ex medio quia res arcessit habere

Sudoris minimum, sed habet comoedia tanto

Plus oneris quanto veniae minus.

Adspice, Plautus 170

Quo pacto partes tutetur amantis ephebi,

“ J uppiter fitque Divi omnes hoc dederunt
Ut Titus Quinctius dictator (Romfinus)
Oppida n6vem (diebus novem) ciperetl’

To such specimens os Saturnian verse Ho-
race’s epithet is not misapplied3 but 1 be·
lieve, with all deference ιο Niebuhr, that
they afford no ides of the structure of the
Saturnian verse. Any natium with any
pretension to poetry, would have something
better than this.

161. Serus enim]
understood here.

163. Quid Sophocles et Thespis et
Aeschylus] Thespis is here introduced as
being the reputed founder of Greek uagedy.
It is doubtful whether any of his plays were
translated by or known to the Roman trage-
dians, of whom Horace has mentioned
Livius, Ennius, Naevius, Pacuvius, and
Accius. We know of no others earlier than
Accius the last of these3 and the number of
tragedies by these writers, the titles of
which have been preserved, is 119. As ιο
Thespis, see AR. 275, n.

167. metuitque lituram] That is, they
were bold enough in their style, and had the
spirit of tragedy in them, but they did not
look sufficiently to the correction and polish-
ing of their languagcz they admitted words
which were out of taste, and thought too
much care in composition beneath them.
This is pretty much what he says of Lucilius
(S. i. 10. 56, sqq.).

168. arcessit] See Epp. i„ 5. 6, n.
‘ Ex medio’ is from common life. Horace
says comedy is supposed to be very easy,
because the matter is common; but, in
fact, it gives more trouble in proportion to
the readiness with which it is criticised and
faults are detected and condemned.

170. Plautus] Orelli thinks he sees in

⁸ Romanus ² must be

this place remarkable plemam-y (⁴ singu-
larem festivitatem a nullo adhuc animad—
versam ⁹). Suetonius (vit. Aug. c. 89) says e
⁸⁸ Augustus plane poematum quoque non
imperitus, delectabatur etiam comoedia ve-
teri, et saepe eam exhibuit publicis specla-
culis.” He thinks therefore Horace is joking
the emperor upon this taste of his for the
old comic writers. However this may be,
it appears that Horace had no great opinion
of Plautus, all whose greatness, he says, lay
in the drawing of small parts. Niebuhr
judgae otherwise: he <alls him one of the
greatest poetieal geniuses of antiquity. ‘⁸ He
shows his great talent in his bold and free,
though somewhat singular, manner of deal·
ing with his characters. He takes Greek
pieces with Greek ¹ dramatis personae,’ and
mats them with a perfect irony. The
Greeks in his plays speak out, and are witty
as Romans would be. What makes Plautus
such a wonderful poet is, that on this
slippery ground he always shows the most
extraordinary skill in hitting the right
point. His language is no less admirable
than his poetical skill. If we compare his
language with that of his predecessore, we
find it greatly altered, enriched, and refined,
which is aproof that the language was much
cultivated at that timea for had this not
been the case, it would certainly be very
different from what it is in the comedioe of
Plautus’' (v. iv. p. 261, sq.). The lang-uage
of Plautus would be rough to the ears of
Horace, and his jokes and allusions, drawn

rincipally from the lower orders, or taken
{mm the Greek and adapted ιο the common
sort of people, did not interest him. Ho-
race's taste was not of a very masculine
order, and it is not difficult to understand
his failing to appreciate Plautus.
