Q. HORATII FLAGOI

CARMINUM

LIBER SECUNDUS.

 

CARMEN Ι.
Δ.σ.ο. 724—25.

Ροιιιο retii-ed from public effen-e, in which he had taken en active pert for twenty years,
ester the triumph he obtained for his victory over the Parthini, en Illyrian people‚ A.u.c.
715 (v. 16), and betook himself to literature, but confined himself et first chiefly to dre-
mntic writing. It appears from Suetonius (de Illust. Grnm. ο. 1⁰) thet he did not unda-take
his history till nster the death of Sallust, Α.υ.ο. 720 (see Clinton, Ρ. H. e. 39 n.c.),for
it was efter that event thet he became acquainted with the grammarian Atteius, who fur-
niehed him with mles for composition. And if the history was not begun tm thet year,
even though (es ie probable) Pollio should heve taken notes of most of the mentione
he hed to relate, with a great many of which he had been personnlly connected, it ie not
probable that eo large e work, consisting of seventeen books, end taking in the whole
period from the first triumvirete to the conclusion of the civil were, could heve been so
fnr completed u to be communiented to his friends before the year Α.υ.ο. 723, which wne
the year of the battle of Actium. But the words ‘⁴ erma nondum expietis uncte cruoribus '¹
(v. 4, αφ), coupled with ⁴⁶ cui dabit parton scelus expiandi Juppiter ” (C. i. 2. 29, οφ),
make it likely that thece two odes were written about the eume timu thet is to any,
shortly ester the battle end before Augustus had established hie government in the con-
fidence of the people. It ie true Lambinus end nome of the older commentatore were of
opinion that the history of Pollio ie not meant, but only hie tragediee, which they eey
related to the events of the times, and which Horace wishes him to lay mide for n while
end give his attention to public affairs, until the republic ehould be settled. So they in-
terpret '
--“ mox ubi publicae
Res ordinaris grande munus
. Cecropio rQetoe cothurno.”

But there is no reason to suppose any of Pollio’s tragedies had reference to the events of

the day, while his history related to nothing else. The Scholiasta understood the history
to be referred to (see note on v. lo).

The ode m written nster hearing Pollio recite pert of hie ποι-1η a practice which he
is nid to heve been the first to introduce among literni-y men at Rome-

ARGUMENT.

The civil vars, their causes, their faults, their progr-ese, the sporta of fortune, and the
fatal leugues of chiese, end arms stnined with blood not yet atoned for‚-—e dengerous
