xxii . IN TRODUGTION.

O. i. 3.—-This is another of the Asclepiadem metres, consisting of
two verses alternating thus ε

...zi-oeſtron-

--Ι-ψυΙ-ΙΙ-υυΙ-υῡ-

The first of these verses is called after Glycon, a poet whose age and
birthplace are unknown. The second verse is the same as O. i. 1. To

this metre also belong O. i. 13. 19. 36; iii. 9. 15. 19. 24. 25. 283 iv.
i. 3. · ’

Ο. i. 4.—'rhis meti-e has its name from Archilochus of Paros. It
consiste ofalternate verses, of which the first is one of those that the
grammarians call ἀσυνάρτητα ⁸, because they consist of different mea-sures
which do not blend together. The first four feet are those of an hexa-
meter verse, after which follow three trocheeS, the first part being
always distinct from the second. The second is a catalectic iambic tri-
meter, that is, it has one syllable wanting in the last foot. There is no

other Ode in this metre.

C. i. 5.——This is also reckoned with the Asclepiadem metres, thou⁸gh
only the two first lines have their name from Asclepiades, being the
same as G. 1. 'Phe third is called after Pherecrates, the comic poet of
Athens. It consists of a dactyl between two spondees, if my ear does
not deceive me3 but it is usual to mark it with a spondeo, choriambus,
and long syllable. The fourth is the Glyconean verse, which occurs in
O. 3. To this metre belong O. i. 14, 21, 233 iii. 7, 133 iv. 13.

and perhaps in the line of Horacez
‘ Quindecim Diana preces virorum!

If Horace has generally avoided this form of the verse, the dislike seems to have been
diminished as his ear improved3 ao that while there is bu't one instance of such a cae-
sura in the second book of the Carmina, and not one in the third, there are no less than
twenty-two in the fourth, and in the Carm. Sec. one on an average in every stanza.
Nay, even in such lines &a ⁸ Doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae ⁸ we prefer the double
trochee accent at the commencement to that which Dr. Carey considers so sweet, who
virtually makes ‘ chorus ' a trochee‚ and would, we suppose, give the sound of a dactyl to
Romulae in ‘ Romulae genti date remque prolem Ι que Et decus omne! If any one will
read over the C. S. with the accent we contend for, he will readily perceive the beauty of
the meu-e, and cease to wonder that Sappho and Catullus hesitaoed not to make the fourth
syllable short. In particular much beauty will be added to the line ⁸ Jam Fides et Pax
et Honos Pudorque.’ According to Dr. Carey's notion of a metrical secent, ⁴ Pax’ vin
lose all emphasis.”

⁸ πρῶτος ἀσυναρτὴτοις Ἀρχίλοχος κὲκχρηται (Hephaestion, p. 48, ap. Bentley on
Epod. ii.). The Scholiast on Hephaestion, p. 52, says there were no less than sixty-
four meti-es of this sort used by the Greeks.
