Magnessam Hippolyten dum sugit abstinens ;

Et peccare docentes

Fallax historias movet.

heve ‘Jmonet Porcellini takoe no notice
of this useof‘ movere,' andin thie place
he mde‘ monet! ‘Mentionem movere'
occurs in Livy· ‘centus movere’ in Virgil-

‘carmen movere’ in Ovid. ‘Historias
movere’ ie therefore a leptimate expra-

sion, and more forcible then‘ monere. ’ In
Ovitl (A. A. iii. 651) the common reading
is‘ ‘Quid juvat ambages praeceptaque parve
movere. ²'’ where Burmann has adopted
‘finovere aster the editio princep ιι, the
Aldine, and nine MSS. observing that the
words are osten confused. ‘Monet' and
‘'mouet ere easily consounded. Bentley
proposes ‘'pellnx for‘ fellax’ without antho-
rity. The word occurs only once, ‘pellacis
Ulixei’ (Aen. ii. 90), where many MSS.
heve ‘fallacisl The reading ‘pellaciess
quoted by Bentley from Georg. iv. 443, is
satisfactorily shown by Wagnerto be wrong.

But, if thet reading be correct, the word
seems to have been irregulerly coined from

‘pellicio' for the occasion. It therefore
has the sense of ennolion, which in the
above passage of virgil has no lace. The
proper form of the adjective ‘pelli-
cere' is ¹ llexf the ¹¹crude form being

‘pellic-’- tis doubtful whether-⁴ pellaei&
..ny more thm‘ pellax' is a word belonging
properly to the latin language.
