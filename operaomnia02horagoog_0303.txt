HORATII FLAOGI

Aut herba lapathi prata amantis et gravi

Malvae salubres corpori,

Vel agna festis caesa Terminalibus,

Vel haedus ereptus lupo.

Has inter epulas ut juvat pastas oves
Videre properantes domum,

Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves
Collo trahentes languido,

Positosque vernas, ditis examen domus,

Circum renidentes Lares l
Haec ubi locutus fenerator Alphius,
J am jam futurus rusticus,
Omnem redegit Idibus pecuniam,
Quae& Kalendis ponere.

The ‘attagen' is usually said to be the
mour-fovi. Mutia says it wan ono of their
most delicions birds (xiii. 61) :—

⁴⁴ Inter sapores fertur alitum primus
Ionicarum gustus attageuarum.''

It is repentaedly mentioned by Aristophauoe.
Aristode, in his Histoi-J of Animula, num-
ber· it among κονιστικοὶ ὄρνιθες, bird·
which do not Β] high.

than others. The thrifty would eat them
for economy. That is the idea Horace
meam to oonvey. Martini introduces tho
ἷιιιςιο dish to make a plain moal (x. 48.

⁴⁴ -— Una ponetur coenula mensa
Hoedus inhumani raptus ab ore lupi.”

Porphyrion explains Horaoe's meaning by·

sayiug ⁴⁴ faetus gratior ex perdito.'’

61. utjuvat] See v· 19. “ ut gaudet?

65. vernas, ditis examen domum] ⁴⁴ Tur-
baque vernarum saturi bona signa coloni ”
(Tibun. ii. 1. 23). ⁴ Verna' was a slavo
born in the owner-'s house. There was a
hearth near which the {mages of the Lares
were placed, in the oentre of the ‘atr-ium,'
the entrance-roem. aud round it the slaves

had their supper. Columella (R. R. xi. 1.
19, quoted by Cruquius) ειμι ‘⁴ Con-uem
(villicus) rusticos cim Imm domini fo-
cumque familiarem semper epulari.’' un·-
fiel (iii. 58. 22) hase—

⁴⁴ Cingunt serenum lactei focum verme
Et larga festos lucet ad hm sylva,”

which favours the nofiou that ⁴ renidentes ⁹
means shiniug by the light of the fite, al-
though Orelli says it does not. ⁴ Cheerful ’
is the sense. Rutgersius refers the word to
⁴ ναι-ηαξ aud Doerinff partly approven. It
includes both ⁴ Lares aud ⁴ vernas! 'rho

67. Haec ubi locutus] Mancineui, who
was an acute as well as learned man, sup-
poses Horace to mean, that on hearing him
declaim upon the charms of the country
the usurer determined to be a sarmer, and
he under-stands ⁴ snm ⁹ after ⁴ locutus!
Though no doubt he is wrong, he saw that

Stepheus notices the samo inoelirpretation.
Au usui-er of this name is mentioued by
Columella (de R. R. i. 7. 2, quoted by all
the Commentators) as au authority ou the
subject of bad debts. ⁴ Redigere ' (not
⁴ religere‚’ as the Scholiasta and some οἵ
the older editors have it) is the techuieal
word for getting in money out on loun, and
⁴ ponere' for putting it out, aa καταβάλλειν,
βάλλειν, τιθέναι. The eettling days at Rome
were the Kalends, Nones, and Ides. See
Cicero, Div. in Q. Caecil. 17 ς also in Verr.
act. ii. Ι. 1. c. 57), “ Nemo Rabonio mole·-
