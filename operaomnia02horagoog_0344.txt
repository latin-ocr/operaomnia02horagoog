42. Infantis Helenae] The story of
Stesichorus losing his sight as a punishment
for s libel on Helen, end recovering it aster
writing sn epology end recantation, hes
been referred to before (C. i. 16, Introduc-
tion). Other writers attribute the restore-
fion to Helen herself, Horace to her bro-
thers. The story is mentioned, besides
Plato (quoted in the above place), by Iso-
crates (Helen. Bucam. c. 29), Chrysostom
Oret. ii. p. 77), Pausanias (iii. 19), Suides
sub verbo),Lucisn (Ver. Hist. ii. 15). Other
writers refer to Stesichorus' recmtstion or
pnlinode, ss it is called, most of whom are
mentioned in Bergk’s note on the only
fragment of it thet hes been preserved, md
which lm been given before. There ean
be no doubt Horace was well sequsinted
with the whole poem. Why he should
have given ιι different version of the story
from thet of others who must also heve
known it does not appear. The poem must
heve contained s prayer to the Dioscuri.
Much has been written on·the subject by
modern scholam, some of whom ere men·
tioned by Estre. Acron attributes the
blinding and the restoration to the brothers,
but he evidently only follows Horace, while
explain him. Instead of
‘vicem‚' nearly ell the MSS. appear to heve
⁸ vices! Decier prefers ⁸ vicem,’ which he says
is found ‘⁴ dens quelques manuscrits‚'' but he
does not mention which they are. Bentley
knew of only one, which is quoted by Tor·
rentius, but on the authority of thet one he
adopts ⁸ vicem,’ 1 think rightly. Fen men-
tions four other MSS„ but no diligence is
sufficient to truce Fes’s MSS„ for he gives ει
very imperfect list of them. He opposes
⁶ vicem ' very ehu-ply, end nearly all the
editors resd ‘vice⁸ ‘Vice' and ‘prece’
form sn ill-sounding ὀμοιοτέλευτον. Pro-
fessor Key Lat. Gr. 917, n.), referring to
the indepen ent use of ⁶ vicem,' ssys it is
perhaps the equivalent in form end meaning
of the German ‘wegem' It occurerepeetedly
in Livy, ss Bentley hes shown. There is s

(περὶ γυναικῶν, 103. Fr. 6 Bergk) :—

mul· in enti-ostien both in Greek and utin.
Of what follows Porphyrion says, ⁴⁴ urben-
issime obscura dicitur ironis ε in conti-arium
namque accipienda haec: quis enim sic
laudet qui simpliciter egit? ⁶ o quse non es
sordidi generis l nec ossa humans ed mele-
ficia colligis 1’ et reliqus.'' This sufficiently
explains the spirit of the passage (see Argu-
ment), end what is meent by ‘novendiales
dissipare pulveres! It appears, if we ere to
believe the old commentatore, ιο heve been
the practice to bury the ashes nine days
efter death. Servius (on Aen. v. 64) says
the body vves kept at home seven days, on
the eighth it was burnt, end on the ninth
buried, end then he quotes this passage.
Cruquius' Scholinst says ss much, with s
little variation ss to the time of hurning,
which, he says, was on the third deyg
end this is more probeble, st leest ss
regards the poor, who could not sfferd
the ointments necessary to preserve their
dead any time (see Becker’s Gallus, Exc.
on the ⁴ Interment of the Desd ’). Heyne,
on the above passage of Virgil (which
refers to the gemes instituted in memory
of Anchises), end on v. 762 of the same
book, may be consulted. Secred cere-
monies appear to heve been obser-ved (but
we cannot suppose this vves general) for
nine days in honour of the dead (see be-
sides Virgil, 1. c., Stat. Theb. vi. 238, sqq).
But this hes nothing to do with Horace s
meaning. He means to ssy that the witch
dug up the ashes of the dead immediately
(not nine days. ss Foroellini says) efter
their burisl, while they were fresh end
better suiaed on thet account for magicsl
ceremonies. The ashes of the poor are fixed
upon, says Crnquius’ commentator, beccum
they were not watched as the rich msn's
were. ⁶ Novendisles’ usually signifles ⁴ of
