HORATII FLAGCI

Et pugilem victorem et equum certamine primum

Et juvenum curas et libera vina referre.

Discriptas servare vices operumque colores
Gur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutorss
Cur nescire pudens prave quam discere malo?
Versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult;

Indignatur item privatis ac prope socco

Dignis carminibus narrari coena Thyestae.
Singula quaeque locum teneant sortita decenter.
Interdum tamen et vocem comoedia tollit,
Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore;

Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri

of the Doric school, and the poetry of the
Aeolic school. The former was adopted to
a choir. the latter only to a single voice.
The former was so called because it πω
cultivated by the Dorians of the Peloponnesus
and Sicily ε the latter flonrished among the
Aeoliam of Asis. Minor, and particularly in
the island of Lesbos. Τὴο one celebrated
gods and heroes or renowned citizens, and
was used at public festivals or at marriages
and fnnerals: the other expressed individual
thoughts and feelings. Alcams and Sappho
are the chief mpresentatives of the latter
school; of the former Alcman and Stesi-
chorus, Ibycus, Simonides, Bacchylides,
and Pindsr. Stesichorus and Ibycus were
most celebrated sor their poems on mytho-
logical subjecte (⁴ divos puerosque deorum '),
while Simonides and Pindar were the greatest
in ἐπινίκια, hymns in honour of the victore
at publio gemes (‘ et pugilem victorem et
egnum certamine primum '), while the poete
o wine and passion (⁴ juvenum curas et
libera vina ⁹) were Alcaeus, Sappho, si-
monides, and Bacchylides. Horace does
not mention one class of lyric poems. the
thrones or dii-ges for the dead, of which
Simonides was the greatest master.

Asto ‘libera vina’ see S. i. 4. 87, n.

86. Discriptas servare vices] I do not
find that any MSS. heve ‘ dismiptas,’ bnt
1 am much inclined to think that is the
true reading; and considering, as 1 have
said before, that ‘ disci-ibo ¹ is a genuine
form, and that the MSS. are unsafe gnidus
Ἢὲῗζὲ ῗοῑηῗὲεεέἑῗέ. Ῑῶῗῖιῖῶἷὲἔῗῗ
(See C. ii. 13. 23, and Epp. i. 10. 20, n.)
⁴ Vices ' are the parts (S. i. 10. 12, ⁴ defen-
. dente vicem'), and with ‘discriptas’ it

means thepsrts assignedto eachdmof
poeti-y. ‘ operum colores,’ ⁴ the colom-ing
of poems,’ is easily understood.

88. pudens prave] ⁸ Throngh a false
shame,' ‘pudor malus' (Epp. i. 16. 24).
‹humber-ivam] ⁸ The language of common

y e.'

91. coena Thyestae] See C. i. 6. 8, n.

92. decentem] Bentley, upon very little
authority and on bad reasoning, subsfitutes
‘ decentem ' sor ‘ decenter,' the rading os
all the editions before him.

94. Iratmque Chremes] ⁸ Chremes ·’ is
put generally for any father in a comedy.
There is nothing {agie or tnmid in the lan-
gnage of Clitipho’s father in Terence's play
(Heaut. v. 4), which is referred to by the
commentatore. The intensive componnd
of ⁴ litigo' does not occur elsewhere. As to
⁴ plerumque,' in the sense of ‘ interdum,’ see
S. ii. 5. 55, n., and on ‘pedestri’ see C. ii.
12. 9, n.

96. Telephus et Pteleum] These persons
were the subjecte of many tragedies. Each
of the three ' ns wrote upon then, es
will be seen from the fragments in Din-
dorf's collection. Telephus' abject con-
dition, when he went to seek for one to mre
him of his wonnd (see Epod. xvii. 8, n.),
and Peleus, driven from Aegina, and wan-
dering in quest of a purifier for the murder
of his brother Phocus, appear to have been
the points in the history of these persons
chiefly dwelt upon (see Dict. myth). Aris-
tophanes ridicules Euripides for the bom-
bast and beggary of Telephus in two places
(Acheru. 428, sqq.) :—
