HORATII FLAGGI

Et nos quod cures proprium fecisse loquamur. 5
Si te grata quies et primam somnus in horam

Delectat, si te pulvis strepitusque rotarum,

Si laedit caupona, Ferentinum ire jubebo;

Nam neque divitibus contingunt gaudia solis,

Nec vixit male qui natus moriensque fefellit. 10
Si prodesse tuis pauloque benignius ipsum

Te tractare voleS, accedes siccus ad unctum.

- ‘⁴ Si pranderet olus patienter regibus uti

Nollet Aristippus.” ‘⁴ Si sciret regibus uti

Fastidiret olus qui me notat.”

Utrius horum 15

Verba probes et sacta doce, vel junior audi
Cur sit Aristippi potior sententian namque
Mordacem Cynicum sic eludebat, ut aiunt:

Kuinoel ou the first of those passages) hae expression in Theocritus which is obscure,

οὔτε δὲ ὁ ἄτεχνος τὸν ἅτεχνον διδάσκειν
δύναται, ὥς οὐδὲ ὁ τυφλὸς,- ror τυφλόν.
Porphyrion quotee another proverb to the
same effect: ‘⁴ Sue Minervam docet.”

8. Ferentinum] Thia was a municipium
on the Via Latina, about sowy-six miles
from Rome, in the country of the Hernici,
not, ae Torrentius end othere eay, of Etruria,
which was a different place. It still retains
ite neme Ferentino. It appears

been much

not to have
frequented, aud Horace recom-
mends hie friend to go there, if the object
of hie wishes is a quiet life, which he says
ia not without ite recommendatione.

10. mor-imque scienda] Horace uses
⁴ fallere ' ae the Greeks used λανθάνειν (see
C. iii. 16. 32, n.). But it ie only used ab·
aolutely here and iu the next Epistle (v.
103), ‘⁴ secretum iter et fallentis semita
vitae.” Livy ueee it without a substantive
aster it (xxii. 33)= ‘⁸ speculator Carthagini-
ensium qui per biennium fefellerat Romae
deprehensue.” Horace takes hie expression
from the Greek proverb λάθε βιώσας,
which appears to have been uaed by the
Epicuream and Cyrenaica. Plutarch op·
posce the rule iu a treatiee of which the
title is εἰ καλῶς εἴρηται τὸ λάθε βιώσας.
Erasmus quotes ovid (Trlst. iii. 4. 25)=

⁴⁸ Crede mihi bene qui latuit, bene vixit, et
roffffrfm debet quiaque manere πρῶθ’

12. ciem ad unctum] This Comm-
Cruq. explains: ‘⁶ pauper et tenuis ad opu-
lentum et locupletem.” So Porcellini ex·
plaius ⁸ siccus‚' but he does not give any
other example· of thia aenae. There ia au

but beare some likeneee to thia (Id. 1. 51).
where a fox ie represented aa having a daiga

upon a boy'e breakfast 2-
a' δ’ ἐπὶ πήραν
πάντᾳ δόλον τεύχοισα τὸ παιδίον οὗ πρὶν
φαῗὲηπσῖἰζ ἣ ’νιίριστον ἐπὶ tapete: ειιθ-
ι ηε

which meane that the ἴοι ie resolved not to
goewaytillhehaeleflzthe boywithouthie
breakfuet3 and ἐπὶ ξηροῖσι, ⁸ on dry meat,'
meana no meat at all. So ‘siccus means
one who cannot command a diune, or mn
only command a dry one. The Cynica were
called ξηρόφαγοι from their abstinence, and
insigem-yla among the early Christiana vae

13. Su· pranderet olus patienter]- ‘Dio-
greitdoeday wee m} Bmffffie Gygam
while he was waehing some vegetables for
hie dinncr, and he was accoeted thus: εἰ
ταῦτα ἔμαθες προσφέρεσθαι, οὐκ ἂν τυράν-
νων αὐλὰς ἐθεράπευες, alluding to hie hav-⁵
ing been the guest of Dionysius of Syr-cuae.
The answer of Aristippus was ε καὶ αὖ,
εἴπερ ᾔδεις ἀνθρώποις ὁμιλεῖν, οὐκ· ἂν
λάχανα ἔπλυνες.

15. qui mc notat] ‘Not-re ' isuaedin
a bad aenae (see S. i. 6. 2⁰, n.).

18. Meo-dacem cynicum] The character
of Diogenoe is proverbial, and the ator-ies
thataretold of him are toowellknovmto

Antisthenes in character, aud adopted ais
