572 HORATII FLAGOI

EPISTLE V.

Aa to Torquatus, the person whom Horace in thie Epietle invites to dine with him, see
C. iv. 7, Introduction. The occasion was the evening before Caeam-’s birth-day (v. 9),
which Porphyrion mys meane C. Julius Caesar. His birth-day was on the leth July
end thia dinner wan given in the summer (v. 11). But the nme cnem- pnt absolutely
could only apply to Augustus at this time, and Comm- Cmq. differs from the othe
Scholinet, md says rightly it must have been the birth-day of Augustus, which m the
ΞΜ of September. The expression ⁴ aestiva ' doen not accurately correspond to tint
time. for autumn began the day before the Ides of September. But thot is not very
important. The hest is never eo oppressiva nn in September in a verm climate. Frtnke

was kept with especial festivitiee, he thinks it must have been written thet yenr3 in whida
argument he supporto himself by the nge of the wine, which wne drawn off in the second
consulship of T. Statilius Taurus, Asnc. 728. It ie clear thet from these dai: not madi
