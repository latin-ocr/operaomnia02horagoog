46 HORATH FLAOGI

GARMEN XVIII.

There has been preserved in Athenaeus, x. p. 430, s single line of Alcaeus of which the
first verse of this odeis almost a litei-al meletian- The mette also is the same. The
verse is ns follows (44 Bergk)= μηθὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δένδρεον ἀμπέλω.
Whether the rest of the ode is a translation of what follows in the poem of Alcaeus we
have no means of lmowing, but 1 think in all probability it is a close adaptation. 1f
we were not put upon the right scent, as Ι think we are, by the above fragment, we
should suppose Horace had s friend Varus, who had a villa at Tibur, and who was making
a plsntsfion there. Varus was the cognomen of his snd Virgil's friend Quintilius, whose
death is lamented in C. xxiv. of this book. But whether or no he is the person here
referred to, οι· (which appears to Buttmann, and Ι agree with him, the better way of
putting it) whose neme is used for the purpose of giving spirit to the ode, it is quite
impossible to say. “Stel-ilem agrum frustra rimeris‚' as Franks judiciously says cn
another equally impossible question. It has been doubted whether Horace wrote‘ Vare'
or‘ vere? in consequence of a note which appears in the two Scholiasts, Acron and ’
Comm. Cmqa “suadet ut cum vernum competens tempus est nullam arborem prius

‘ qnam vitem ponat,” from which it has been inserted that they had‘ vere' in their copies.
Some confirmation of this theory is derived from Vix-g. Georg. ii. 319, sq. z—
“ Optima vinetis sntio cum vere rubenti
Candida venit avis longis invisa colubris.''

Which Estre states is quoted by Acron. 1 do not find the quotation in my copy. An
existing MSS. and editions have ⁴ Vere! Jahn affirma that this person is ⁸ haud dubie ’
the same as Canidis’e old lover, Epod. v., and Weichert (de L. Varii et Cassii Parmensis
vita) says the same. Such boldness appears to me most irrational. The respectable
names of these scholare have misled the writer of the article Varus (xii.) in Smith’s Dice.
Biog„ who might hsve corrected his judgment by referring to Estre, to whose work he

τθξῗτὲιιιιῖᾆ believes the person to be that unfortunate Varus whose legions were cut

off by Arminius m Gennany, A. n. 1⁰. But as he supposes Catullus to heve addressed
the same person (C. x.), who was his junior by st least half a century, his judgment' is
worth nothing. Other conjectures have been hazarded by scholars of repute, which Estre
hes stated and disposed of very clearly.

⁴⁸ Of Quintilius· Villa ruins yet remain at 'Evoli in the quartm- called aster him Quin-
tigliolo,” says Pes, a credulous but industrious commentator.

ARGUMENT.

The vine is the first trec thou shouldst plant, Varus, by the walls of Tibur. Hsrdships are
only for the sober, wine driven away all cares. Who croaks of battles and poverty
