CARMEN XIV.

A.U.c. 729 or 730.

This ode hae been animadverted upon pretty severely, and even rejected ‘aa epm-iona,
because unequnl to the occasion it wne written for. It may not be one of Horace's beet.
But it wne evidently only ι private affair. It wne composed nt the close of the Cante-
brian war, Α.ιι.ο. 729, when Aug-ustus' return wne expected, or on his return the follow-
ing year. He wne detained by innesu ιιι Tarracone. Frenke gives, from Nor-isius, a frag-
ment of nn inscription which makes it appear probable that Augustus recovered hie benith
end returned in the summer of 730, in which year C. Norbanus Flaccus was consul:

ARGUMENT.

Coeunt ie retnrning a conqueror from Spain, Ο ye people, he who but just went forth like
Hei-<mles to the field. Let his chaete wife end nister go forth to offer ena-ifice with the
metrone, while the young soldiere end their bridee stand reverently by. 1 too will keep
holidny3 for 1 exn ense while Augustus iz lord of the world. Bring flowers, hoy, end
ointment, und my beet old wine, and go bid Neaera come: if the churlish porter
rei-'nee thee, come awa„ 1 have no mind for euife, though 1 might not have horne αι

much in the heydny of my youth.

1. ο plebr,] ‘Plebs' and‘ populus’ ere
used synonymonely (C. ii. 2. 18. sqq) and
either word stands for the common formula
‘populus plebeque Roman& aa, among other
ΡΙιιοοε,οἱο. ιιι Verr.' ii. 5. 142⁴ ‘Mihi Florum
matrem populo plebique Βοιιιιιιιιο ludorum
celebritate placandam. ” Nothing cen be ιιι
worse teste theu the iden of Klotz (Lect.
Ven. p. 317), followed by Gesner, Jmi,
Tute, that Horace meent ιο oppone the ple-
beiam, who were anxious when they heard
of Augustne' illneoe, to the patriciana who
were delighted.

2. Morte venalem] This is an expres-
sion like that of Aeschines (c. Ctee. 77.

26,R212k0),a‘1pardctorw ἡ ἀρετὴ navia.

5. Unico grandem] Livia was never sue·
pected of infidelity to her husband, though
ehe hes been suspected, proybebl without
just reason, of hastening hin death. But
thet which appears to have been the first
cause of disseneion between her and Angue·
tus, the succession of Tiberius, wne not yet
thought of. Horace therefore need not be
accused of bed teste or groesflnttery for what
he here says. Dillenbr. interpreta‘ unico’
