46. Varrone Atacino] Jerome (in Euseb-
ctu-on. Olymp. 174. 8, A.u.c. 672) says
‘⁸ P. Terentius Varro vico Atace in provincia
Narbonensi nascitur qui postea xxxv annum
ἓξὲἶῗρᾛὲῗ gffifflss' {2¹ '¹3:¹13‘ :5:¹3¹ 5⁰ {³1³3
was calle Atacinus, whether from a district
or, as the Scholiasta say, a river of Gallia
Narbonensis (the district is not named, but
Strabo mentions the river, l. iv. p. 181), ιο
distinguish him from M. Terentius Varro,
who is sometimes called Reatinus. The
works attributed to him are named in the
notice of his life in the Dict. Biog. His
attempta at satire,——in which Horace says,
most probably with justice, that he had
failed,—are no where noticed but here.
Comm. Cruq. thus paraphrases Horace's
words: ‘⁴ Hoc erat quod ego melius possem
stu-ibere quam Varro Atacinus et alii multi,
&1203'53323322 uffintffissssffyssssx
explains ⁶ quibusdam aliis ' to mean Ennius
and Pacuvius, which is very improbable.
As we should not have known that Varro
was a satirist is Horace had not mentioned it,
so we may suppose there are others even
among the poets whose names have come
down to us with credit, and many we have
not heard of, who wrote in this style and
made nothing of it. Estre mentions Saevius
Nicanor and'Lenaeus, from Suetonius de
Illust. Grammat. c. δ and 153 and L. Albu-
tius from Varro de Re Rust. iii. 2. 17.
(Addenda, p. 588.)

53. Nil comis traqien· mutat Lucilius
Acci J] ⁸ Comis ' is usually taken ironically.
1 think it is more in accordance with Ho-
race’s temper and the purpose of this Satira,
which is conciliatory, to take it literally as

55

Orelli does, referring ιο the description in
the next Satire, vv. 30, sqq. (see below,
v. 65.) Accius was born ιο. 170, and was a
writer of tragedias, chiefly from the Greek,
but some ‘praetextatam' Cicero calls him
“ gravis et ingeniosus postest (pro Plane.
c. 24), “summus poeta'’ (pro Sextio, c.
56). Quintilian’s judgment will be found
in the note on Epp. ii. 1. 56. Horace
speaks elsewhere (A. P. 259) of ‘⁸ Acci
nobilibus trimetris,” where, as in the
above Epistle‚ he is referring more to the
popular judgment than giving his own.
Gellius (xiii. 2) relates how he read ιο Pa-
cuvius one of his early productioris (Atreus,
a tragedy), and that the old man said, ,
“ sonora quidem esse quae scripsisset et
grandim sed videri ea tamen sibi duriora
paullum et acerbiora.'' Accius acknowledged
it was so, but hoped to mend his style as
he grew older. Gellius finishes his account
of Roman authors (xvii. 21) with ‘⁴ Q.
Ennius et juxta Caecilius et Terentius ac
subinde et Pacuvius, et Pacuvio jam sene
Accius, clariorque tunc in poematis eorum
obtrectandis Lucilius.” Porphyrion has a
note here, “ ἰωὰ autem hoc cum alias tum in
tertio libro et nono et decimo Satirarum.”
55. non ut majore repremit .?] “ Quando
de se loquitur non sic dicit quasi melior sit
illis poetis,” which interpretation of Acron’s
—the true one no doubt—I give because
some editors, including Doering and Hein-
dorf, make another question of this verse,
and translate it thus: ‘⁴ When he speaks of
himself, is it not as one superior to those he
finds fault with ?’'--which is contrary to the
spirit of the passage altogether. Horace
seeks in Lucilius a precedent, not for com-
mending himself, but only for noticing in a
