ancmns Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Ioci,

Si recte frueris non est ut copia major

Ab Jove donari possit tibi.

Tolle querelas 3

Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usne.

Si ventri bene, si lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil 5
Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus,

Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis

Vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus ut te

Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus inauret;

Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit,

10

Vel quia cuncta putas una virtute minora.
Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos

Cultaque dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox ;

1. Fructibus Agrippae] From what
sources Agrippa derived hisimmense wealth
we do not know. From this Epistle we
learn that he had estates in Sicily, probably
given him after his successes against Sex.
Pompeius. Horace means to say to Iccius
that he has got a good post and maybe
very comfortable if he is caresul. He pro·
bably got a per-eentage on what he col-
lected. He is generally called the · procu-
rator ' of Agrippa, and that as a general
term may express his office, since ‘procu-
rator ' was one who acted for another with
his authority. He might be called ¹ coactor'
as collector of rents, but probably his super-
vision was general. But he must not be
ΝἪᾈὝἭἭΜΜ

4. eui rerum suppetit uam] ⁴ Rerum
usus ’ here seems to mean the supply of
things needful. ‘ Suppet0,' meaning ⁸ to be
sufficient,’ occurs in Epod.xvii. 64. ⁴ Pau·
per' is here used more in the sense of
privation than Horace generally uses it.

5. Sa· ventri bene, εἰ lateri] This seems
to be a translation of Solon's verses, quoted
by Plutarch (vit. c. 2), who says of him
πλοῦτον δ’ οὐκ ἐθαύμαζεν ἀλλὰ καί φησιν
ὁμοίως πλουτεῖν ᾦ τε-

πολῦς ἄργυρός ἐστι
καὶ χρυσὸς καὶ γῆς πυρ όρου πεδία,
ἵπποι θ’ ἡμίονοί τε, καὶ μόνα ταῦτα
πάρεστι
γαστρί τε καὶ πλευρῆς καὶ ποσὶν ἁβρὰ
παθεῖν.

7. positorum] ‘Ponere' is the usual
word for putting disbes on the table, as

observed on S. ii. 2. 23. Here fine dishes
are meant, as we can tell by the context.
The nettle ⁴ urtica ’ forms an ingredient in
the broth of poor people in this country,
and still more in Scotland. ‘ Protinus '
means ⁴ right on‚’ and is applied in various
ways. Here it means ⁸ in an uninterrupted
eourse,’ that is, ‘ always.' ⁸ Ut ' means ⁴ even
supposing,' as in Epod. i. 21. ⁸ Confestim,'
¹ straightway,’ has the same root as ⁸ festino,'
which Gellius (xvi. u) says is akin to
⁴ fessus! Th0ugh ⁴ Fortunae rivus ' occurs
no where else in extant writers, it seems. as
Orelli says, to have been a proverbial ex·
prssaeoatmm mutare] Horace says the
same in a different applioetion elsewhere

(Epod. iv. 5)=

‘⁴ Licet superbus ambules pecunia,
Fortuna non mutat genus.’'

12. Miramur ri Democriti] 1 do not
agree with Orelli in his interpretation of
this passage. (See Argument.) Democri-
tus of Abdera had a considerable patrimony,
and he is said to have entertained Xerxes
when as Herodotus relatos, viii. 120) he
stopp at Abdera on his return from
Grecos. (See Diog. Laert. ix. 3⁴.) He
travelled a great part of his life and aquan-
dered his means in this way. (Diog. 1..
iv. 35. 89.) Cicero says he was reported
to have put out his eyes to prevent his
mind from being distractetL and that he
neglected his patrimony and left his lands
uncultivated. (De Finn. v. 29 3 Tusc. Disp-
v. 39.) In whatever way he wasted his
goods it seems his name had passed into a
proverb.
