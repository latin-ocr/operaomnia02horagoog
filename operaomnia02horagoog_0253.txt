Sensere quid mens rite, quid indoles

HORATII FLAGGI

N utrita faustis sub penetralibus
Posset, quid Augusti paternus

In pueros animus Nerones.
Fortes creantur fortibus et bonist,

Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum

VirtuS‚ neque imbellem feroces
Progenerant aquilae columbam ;
Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
Rectique cultus pectora roborante,

Utcunque defecere mores

Indecorant bene nata culpae.
Quid debeaS‚ o Roma, Neronibus

Testis Metaurum flumen et Hasdrubal
Devictus et pulcher fugatis

Ille dies Latio tenebris

Qui primus alma risit adorea,
Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas
Ceu flamma per taedas vel Eurus
Per Siculas equitavit undas.

neas of some editors, who do not understand
their legitimate province, to throw upon the
dishonesty of copyists the desecte they pro-
fess to find in their author (see C. iii. 11.
17. iii. 17, Introduction). ‘’Sed is commonly
used after d·

24. revictae] 'I'he various reading of a
few corrected Mss. ‘repressae,⁹ which the
Scholiast Porphyrion seems to have followed,
and which Bentley hes admitted into the
text, is not nearly so well supported by au-
thority as ‘revictaess and has not its wei g.ht
Porcell. refers to Lucret. (v. 41⁰),⁴ ‘Ignde
cadunt vires aliqua rafione revictaess' and
Orelli to Cic. pro Sulla (1)‚‘ ‘perditi cives
redomiti atque victi.⁹⁹ ‘’Reductae (1 sup
pose for ⁸ redactse⁹), ‘repulsae ⁹ aud other
variatione are to be met with, but ⁸ revictae⁹
is the true reading, and nobody will think
it neoessary to follow Bentley in changing
⁴ sausfis' into ⁸ sanctis' without any better
authority than his taste in epitheta. That
⁴ re ⁹ is added to some verbs without mate-
rially changing their meaning has been shown
before, C. i. 31. 12, n. The difference be-
tween ‘ mens' and ‘ indoles⁹ is, that one
refers to the head, the other to what we
should call the heart, the disposition.

29. I‘brtee creantur] It is more than

igressions to recover the thread

probable that Horace had in his mind Euri·
pides⁹ words, —

ἐσθλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνδρων ἐσθλὰ γίγνεσθαι. τέκνα,
εακων δ’ ὅμοια τῇ φύσει τῇ τοῦ πατρός.

(Fr. Alcm 7.)

‘Fortibus et bonis⁹ coi-responde to the com·
mon Greek expression which it is so diffi-
cult to render, καλοῖς κάγαθοῖς. These
words are in the ablative case. Orelli hae
quoted several instances of their use by
Cicero. Among others, see cic. in Verr. ii. 3.
69,* ‘Quem ego, judices, quamvis bonum for-
temque facile paterer evadere,'⁹ δια, where
hesays he should be glad to see Verre& son
turn out a better man than his father,
which he thinks is possible, though (on
Horace⁹ s principle) not probable. ug'l'hose
whom Horace is referring to are the wor-
thies of the claudian family, not, as Orelli
rightly observes, to the unworthy father of
the two youths whom Augustus had adopted,
and one of whom (Drusus) was believed,
not without reason, to be his own son.
⁴ Indecorant⁹ and ⁴ dedecorant’ (v. 36) are
both supported by good MSS. The least
likely form to have been invented is ⁴ inde-
corant,⁹ and (as it is consistent with ana-
logy) 1 bave ou that account adopted it.
Bentley prefers, but does not adopt it.
