were but three in which judicial business
was trsnsected (iii. 38):
“ esum, inquis, egem Cicerone disertius
ι so,
Attfue erit in triplici per mihi nemo
foro.”

In every ⁴ forum ' there wes a ⁴ basilice '
(or more than one), a building devoted to
the joint purposes of judicisl sud com-
mercinl business. At the end of the build-
ing wss a. pert called ‘tribunnL’ devoted to
law (for which the eerly ones were exclu-
sively intended); snd in a later ⁶ besilics’
(thet of Trajan) there was a ⁴ tribund ⁹ et
eech end. (See Dict. Ant.) There was in
the Forum Romanum the Basilice Porcia,
erected by M. Porcius Ceto when hewes
consul, Α.υ.ο. 5⁴2. Plutarch mentions its
erection in his life of Ceto the Censor
(c. 19), end in thet of Ceto of Utica (c. 5)
he says thet here the tribunes did their
business, and here Ceto fiat distinguished
himself es a speeker. There were slso two
Basilicee Aemiliae erected or restored by
Aemilius Psulus. Julius Ceessr built one
oelledesterhimJulie. This ie referredto
in the insu-iption above quoted, which
places it between the temples of Saturnus
end Cesterg but the positione of these ere
doubtful. Here the ⁶ centumviri ⁹ held their
court. (See S. i. 9. 35, n.) L. Opimius,
who wes consul, Ast-c. 633, built a basilice,
end called it nster himselfg snd Augustus
built one in honour of his grandsons, Lu-
cius snd Ceius, probably in his own Forum
(Sueton- Aug. c. 29). Others were built
in the course of time.

68. vel porco vel bove] The enimds
most commonly sem-ificed by the Roman·
were sheep, pig-s, end oxen. On public oc-
cssione these three were sacrificet! together,
end the stoeiflce was called ⁴ suovetaurilim'
being e combinetion of the three names.
Such a nofifioe is represented on one of the
four penels on Constantine’s arch, of which
