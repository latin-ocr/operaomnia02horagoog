CARMEN XXV.

A.1J.0. 724 (Ξ).

This ode reads at first like en introduction to one on a lurger seule in honour of Augus-
tus, but we need not suppose that such e eequel ever m composui. Tho occasion, to
judge by the enthusiasm of the hnguege, may have been the announcement of the taking
of Alexandria A.u.c. 724.

ARGUMENT.

Bacchus, whither dost thou hui-ry me? In what woods or caves shall 1 sing of cmm·
added to the gods, e new und noble sti-ain unheard before? As the sleepleec Euiad
looks out from the heights upon the sacred hille end rivers of Thrace, so do 1 love to
wander by the river-side und in the eilent grove. Ο thou lord of the Nympha, no
vulgar ati-ain will 1 sing. 1 will follow thee, for the danger of thy company is sweet.

Quo me, Bacche, rapis tui

Velox mente nova? quibus

Dicam insigne recens adhuc

Indictum ore alio, Non secus in jugis

Hebrum prospiciens et nive candidam

Lustratum Rhodopen, ut mihi devio

2. quae nemora] Some MSS. heve
‘quae in nemoress but the proposition be-
fore‘ specus' governs both nouns. Dil-
1011er s distinction between⁴ specus' und
‘’nntrum is unintelligible to me: “specus
dicitur de solitudine nc vastitate loci; antrum
de divino poetarum deversorio! ' ‘ Spec-us'
seems to conmin the same root u σπέ- -ος,
the original meaning of which is unknown.
The derivation οῖ’ αντρον ic equally uncer-
tain. Etymology 'therefore gives us no

5p meditans] I take‘ inserere '‘usten- cu-
dinr.' Some may prefer its being governed
by ‘ meditans! This word, which is the
same ις μελετᾶν, signifies ⁴ to revolve in
the mind‚' and osten expresses the giving
utterance to that which the mind has con-
ceived. Here 1 think it has the same menn-

ing ae Virgil’s “musam modim-is avennss’

“meditaris arundine musom.” Aguin Dil-
lenbr. hue en arbitra-y distinction between
ereceness ‘that which hus never been heard
before,' and ‘ indictum,' ⁴ that which hu
never been spoken before!

7. Dicam iussique] ⁴ Aliquid' or ⁴ carmen'
must be supplied.

9. &somnis clupei Baiae] The Bne-
chaual catchee inspiration by looking out
from the hill-tops upon the haunts of the
god, end so the poet turns auide from hin
wonted path to the river-benite and grown
where Bacchus is found. The picture of the

moonlight winter’ s night upon the quiet
plains of Thrace, end dawing inspiretion
