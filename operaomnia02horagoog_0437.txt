more severe than Horace’s “incertus scam-
num faceretne Priapum maluit esse deum.”
Not much less in the same strain is that
address of Martial (viii. 40) :—
⁴⁴ Non horti neque palmitis beati

Sed rari nemoris, Priape, custos,

Ex quo natus es et potes renasci,

Furaces moneo manus repellas,

Et silvam domini focis reserves.

Si defecerit hoc et ipse lignum es.”

The figures cf Priapus were generally busts
like the Hermae, but sometimes they were
full length of the kind Horace describes.
Usually they held a sickle or a club in
their right hand by way of frightening
thieves, and a wisp of straw, or something
of that sort, to frighten the birds. Priapus
also symbolized the fertility of nature in the
later mythology of the Greeks as well as
the Romans. In Agostini's collection of
gems (part ii. pl. 13) there is one represent-
ing a sacrifice ιο Priapus, where he stands
at fun length on a high pedestal, with a
thyrsus in one hand, resting on his shoulder.
The offerings are a goat's head and fruita,
which a woman is laying on a rude altar,
while a man is bringing up a basket on his
head containing more fruit and ‘ phalli‚'
which formed a feature in the worship of
Bacchus as wellas of Priapus. These two
were honoured alike as presiding, the one

is a combination of the two divinities.

6. importunos volucres] Virgil applies
the same epithet to destructive birds:
‘⁴ Obscoenaeque canes importunaeque volu-
cres ” (Georg. i. 470). Cruquius explains
the word thus: “ Quod sine ulla Dei reve-
rentia quovis tempore essent molestae. '⁹
The word is used with a variety of mean-
ings, to reduce which ιο one character
we must know more of its etymology
than Forcellini tells us on the authority
of Festus.

7. Huc prius unqu-rtis] Outside of the
walls in front of Mons Esquilinus lay the

Campus Esquilinus, in which were buried
the poorest of the people in ill-dug graves,
which had-the name ⁴ puticuli,’ whether as
the diminutive of ⁴ putei? or from the putre-
faction of the corpses and the stench therehy
occasioned, Varro hesitates ιο decide. Τὶιο
manner of their funeral is here stated with
painful satire. The poor wretch is neg-
lected by his masten and a fellow slave,
out of his ‘ peculium,’ goes to the expense
of hiring (⁴ locabat') ‘ vespillones ³ (common
comae-hearers, νεκροφόρους) ιο carry him
out on a bier to the public burial-ground.
where his corpse was tossed naked into a
pit into which other corpses had been tossed
before. This scene could not have occurred
in all its particulata very often, since every
master was bound by law to bury his slave,
and if any one did it for him he was entitled
to recover the cost of the funeral from the
master of the slave (Dig. ll. 7. 31, quoted
in Dict. Ant. p. 874). The ‘vilis arca’ was
called ‘ sandapila, ’ whose narrow dimen-
sions are referred to in an epigram ot· Mar-
tzial (ii. 81), where he says of the stout
o'ilus 2—
“ laxior hexaphoris tua sit lectica licebit
Dum tamen haec tua sit, Zoi‘le, sanda-
pila est.”

And again, speaking of a mistress whose
extravagant demands were reducing her
lover ιο poverty (ix. 3),—

“ Octo Syris suffulta datur lectica puellaez
Nudum sandapilae pondus amicus erit.”

Suetonius, at the end of his life of Domi-
tian, says, ‘⁴ Cadaver eJ'us populari sanda-
pila per vespillones exportatum.”
