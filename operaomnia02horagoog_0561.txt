SATIRE v111. ’

ThisSstirerepresentsndinnergivenbysriehvulgurmsntoMneeemsnndfiveof his
friends. There ,is not so much to distinguish it in the way of humour ss the subject
admitted of. Few subjecta present more scope for fseetious satire thnn the nire of low-
born men, letely become rich, nping the ways of the fushioneble world, und making walth
their one pessport into what is eulled good society. This is n very slight sketch, and
some of the soree evenof this is perhaps lost through our ignorunoe of little points of
etiquette and culinnry refinements observed by the Romans of that day.

The host⁹s neme is Nasidienus Rufus. Who he was it is impossible to say. Imbinns
supposes Q. Salvidienus Rufus to be meent, a man of obscure origin whom Augustus
sdvenoed to equestrinn rank for services rendered against Sex. Pompeius, und who m
nsterwnrds eonsul designatum. He put un end ιο himself in mmo. 714, which was long
before this Satira was written, und the theory would not be worth mentioning if Heindorf
und Buttmann had not supported it. Spohn (Jahn’s Horace, Ed. ii. p. 271) supposes
Q. Nasidius. one of the commanders under M. Antonius, end mentioned by Dio cassius
(i. 13) ιο be the host. But ns we eunnot urrive et any real knowledge on the subject,
undas the essenos of theSefire eonsists in theobscmityof the pes-son,it isuselessto
speculato about him.

Instead of telling the story himself, though it is probuble from the tone of the 8⁸12·oe
thet he writes from e seene he hed witnessed, Horeoe puts it into the mouth of his ffiend
Fundanius, the comie writer mentioned in S. i. 10. 42, where see note.

It is impossible to conjecture with any probability the date of the Satin-e, though it may
be assumed thet it was written ester Horaee⁹s intimacy with Maecenas hed begun.

“ Ur Nasidieni juvit te coena beati?
Nam mihi quaerenti convivam dietus here illio
De medio potare die? “ Sie ut mihi nunquam

 

1. Nasidieni] See Introduction. The
third und fourth syllables eoelesoe. ⁴ Beati ⁹
means wenlthy and favoni-ed of fortune.
See C. i. 4.14, n.

2. here] ‘⁶ ‘Here’nunemioen terminu·
mus, nt veterum eomioorum adhuc. libris
invenio ‘ heri ad me venit :⁹ quod idem in
epistolis Augusti quas sua manu scripsit
aut emendavit deprehenditur '’ (Quint. i. 7).
⁴ Heri ⁹ is u dative form, ⁴ here ⁹ an abln-
tive3 so we heve ‘muni' und ‘mnne' in
the morning, ⁴ vesperi ⁹ und ‘vespere' in
the evening. The termination in ⁴ i ⁹ is the
older of the two, and, from the above
remark of Quintilian compared with this

of Horace, it would seem u if the

ussgeof thewordwns inusteteof trund-
tion ut this time. (See Key's L. G. 959.)

3. De medio potare dia] Nasidienus
dined early ιο make the most of his feast.
But ⁸ medio die⁹ need not be taken quite
literelly. The ⁸ prandium ⁹ was usually
taken st noon. The diunenhour was inter.
(See C. i. 1. 20, n.) Busy men, ns we saw
in S. 7. 33, sat down by cendio-light. ⁶ De
medio die ⁹ is like ⁴ de nocte ⁹ in Epp. i. 2.
32, ‘medin de luoe,' Epp. i. 14. 34. Ρω-
fessor Key thinks thet in thie use of ⁴ de ⁹
the notion of u part of time is contained,
end that it may therefore be best rendered
