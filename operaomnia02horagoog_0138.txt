CARMINUM II. 13.

Num tu quae tenuit dives AchaemeneS,

Aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes

Permutare velis crine Licymniae,
Plenas aut Arabum domos?

Dum flagrantia detorquet ad oscula

Cervicem aut facili saevitia negat,
Quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi,
Interdum rapere occupet.

at her festival were led by ladies of rank
(see C. iv. 6. 31. A. P. 232). This and
the nse of 4 dedecuit’ shows that the person
intended by Licymnia was not as some snp-

pose a mistress of Horace's. To such a per- ⁴

son the notion of being ‹li by dancing
at a private house would not apply. 4 Choris '
appears to be opposed to the sacred dances.
Dancing was not unusual in private society
at this n'me even among hdies. Therefore
it was not degrading even to Terentia, who
was probably fond of this amusement. J ani

words will not bear that meaning, and
Horace is only referring to two kinds of
ἀεικείης, private and public. Other words
used with 4 brachia’ to express dancing are
4 5⁸0¹:oess 4 deducere: 4 ducme,’ 4 mittere‚’ 4 mo·
vere ’ (see Forcell. Brachia). The gracesul
motion of the arms seem to have been one
of the chief attractione in dancing, as it is
still wherever it is practised as an art.

44 Si vox est, cantat si mollia brachia, salta.”
44 Brachia saltantis, vocem mirare canentis,”
says Ovid (A. A. i. 5953 ii. 305).

The expression ‘ ferre pedem' is used by
virgil (Georg. i. ll): 44 Ferte simul Fau-
nique pedem Dryadesque puellae ;” and

4 ludere ' likewise (Ec. vi. 27) = 44 Tum vero
in numerum Faunosque ferasque videres
Ludere-'¹ 4 Dianae celebris die is the day
on which Diana was worshipped, the people
fiocking to her temple for that purpose. On
this sense of 4 celebris,’ see Mr. Long's note
on cic. in Verr. Act. ii. l. 2. c. 66, where
the connexion of 4 celebris ’ and 4 creber’ is
satisfactorily shewn.

not strictly maintained between this stanna
and the one before it; but it is easily under-
stood. Some MSS. and hmbinus bave
‘ fragrantia,’ the author of which reading
must have had in mind Horace's amusing
denunciation in Epod. iii. 19, sqq„ aster
he himself had been poisoned with Mae-
cenas’ garlic.

27. ‘poscente' goes with ‘magis‚' not
with ⁴ eripi,’ as some suppose. 4 More than
you who ask) not as Rutgersius says,
4 more than the woman who aska! The
Scholiast Acron read 4 occupat' in v. 28,
which carries the word back to 4 dum' (v.
25), instead of connecting it as is natural
with 4 gandeat! Bentley reads 4 occupat ς’
all the editions before him that 1 have seen
have 4 occupet‚' and the older MSS. 4 Θο-
cupare’ has the force of φθάνειν. See
Foroell. and Index.

CARMEN XIIL
A.U.c. 728 (Ξ).

'rh-e date of this ode is fixed with some confidence by Franke A.o.c. 728, by Dillenbr.
729, because it was written the year before C. iii. 8. (See Introduction to that-ode, and
iii. 29.) The invitation to Maecenas was written evidently for the first anniversary of the
accident referred to in this ode. Lachmann (Ep. to Franke, p. 240) considers itto be one
of Horace's earliest, in consequence of the metre of v. 27, 44 Alcaee, plectro dura navis ;”
and for similar reasons he puts C. iii. 8 at an early date. But such conclusione have been
already notice& . There is nothing in them, as 1 believe, whatever. The latter part of
the ode is a remarkable instance of Horace's way of digressing into subjects only remotely
connected with his principal theme.
