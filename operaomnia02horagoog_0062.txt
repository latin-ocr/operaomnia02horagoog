ἀσυνέτημι τῶν ἀνίμων στάσιν·
τὸ μέν γὰρ’ ἔνθεν κῦμα κυλίνδεται
τὸ δ’ ἔνθεν· ἄμμες δ’ δν τὸ μέσσον

This fragment (18 Bergk) of one of Alcaeus’ odes (the first verse of which is manifestly
imperfect) is thus introduced by Heraclides, the Alexandrian grammarian: ἐν ἱκανοῖς δὲ
καὶ τὸν Μιτυληναῖον μελοποιὸν εὖρὴσομεν ἀλληγοροῦντα. τὰς γὰρ τυραννικὰς ἐξουσίας
χειμερίῳ προσεικάζει καταστήματι θαλάσσης ἀσυνίτην καὶ τῶν ἀνίμων articam—Tic
οὐκ ἂν εὐθὺς ἐκ τῆς προτρεχούσης περὶ τὸν πόντον εἰκασίας ἀνδρῶν πλωϊζομένων

καί τυραννικὴ κατὰ Μιτυληναίων ἐγειρομένη σύστασις. There ean beno doubt that this
ode of Alcaeus was in Horaee's mind when he wrote: that the former is sn allegorice!
description of the politiesl troubles of Mitylene is certain: it is therefore surprising to
find Graevius supporting Muretus' opinion, that no politieal auegory is meunt by Horace,
bnt only sn address to the ship which had brought him from Philippi, sud was returning
