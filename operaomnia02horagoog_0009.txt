viii ' PREFAGE.

has added them to his own commentary in a separate form. These
scholia are referred to under the abbreviated title of Comm. Gruq.
They are chiefly made up of the commentar-ies of Acron and Por-

* phyrion, with some additions apparently from other old authorities.

The readings of these three Scholiasts help out the MSS„ though
sometimes they are not supported by any that are known now·

The editions that I have consulted I will not tire the reader by
enumerating. No classical author has been edited and commented
upon so often as Horace. The editions I have always referred to
when a difficulty of interpretation occurred are those of Ascensius
(1519), with the scholia of Acron and Porphyrion, Lambinu8‚
Oruquius (for his commentator), TorrentiuS, Gesner, Doering, Dillen-
burger, and Orelli. From these 1 have got real help, especially from
Torrentius, whose commentary is in general clear, learned, and judi-
cious. I have often referred to the French editors Sanadon and
Dacier, but their judgment is not to be trusted. The old edition of
Laudini, published at Florence in 1482, and reprinted at Venice the
next year, is in my possession, and will be found frequently referred to
for various readings as “ Ven. 1483‚'' or simply “ Ven.'' Fea has a
good many sensible notes, but Ι have found him most useful for
inscriptions, of which he gives several. J ani and Mitscherlich have
edited the Odes, but are so redundant in quotation and admiring
exclamation, that their commentaries are disagreeable. The Satires
are much indebted to the learning and diligence of Heindorf, whose
copious notes and judicious prefaces must be of use to any one who
consults them, though his text 1 do not think is always well chosen.
His notes on law-terms are valuable, but in such matters I have
been chiefly indebted to the judgment of my friend and coadjutor
Mr. Long, whose advice I have likewise followed in many other
particulars.

Ι have not entered at any length upon the chronolog-y of Horace's
poems. I have referred to the subject in the Introduction, and
