HORATII FLAGOI

Est mihi purgatam crebro qui personet aurem ε
Solve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne
Peccet sd extremum ridendus et ilia ducat.

Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono,

Quid verum atque decens curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum ς
Gondo et compono quae mox depromere possim.

Ac ne forte roges quo me duce, quo lare tuter,

Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri

Quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes.

torial shows st this time were exhibited in
the Circus. The arena was separated from
the sests, which went round the building,
by s wsll called the‘ podium? near which
s gladiator would station himself to sppesl
to the compassion of the people, at whose
nequest it usually⁴ wss that they got their
freedom end the ‘rudisss We lesrn from
Juvenal thst the persons of highest condi·
tion sst by the ‘podium,' and to their in-
fluence the appesl would be more imnis·
distely made. He says (ii. 1⁴5)=
44 Et Capitolinis generosior et Marcellis

Et Catulis Psulisque minoribus et Fabiis et

Omnibus ad podium spectantibusl’

Lipsius (de Amp hith. c. xi.) supposes thet
there wss between the‘ podium’ and lowest
sest s level space, in which the principal
personages sat, the curule officers‘ ιιι their
own chsirs. Veianius, Horace says, retired
into the country to escape the temptation
to engage himself ’,n and to place him-
self in the position ehad so oflzen occu-
pved of s suppliant for the people' s favour.
hen they liked a man they were not easily
persuaded to ssk for his discharge.

7. Est mihi pnryatam] He ghas a voice
within him, he says, the office of which is to
whisper' ιιι his attentive ear the precept that
follows, the idea of which is taken from
Ennius, who takes it from the Circus. His
words, in Cicero de Senect. (c. 5) are, —

44 Sicut fortis equus spatio qui saepe su-
remo

Vicitp Olympia, nunc senio confectu’

quiescit.”
The reverse of ‘purgatam surem,’ which
wss s conventioual expression, is found
in the next Epistle ςν. 53),⁴ ‘auriculas col-
lecta sorde dolentes.

9. ilia ducat.]‘11ietrahere’or ‘ducere’
are ordinary expressions for panting: they
mean to contr-act the flanks, ss is done in
the act of recovering the bresth. The re-
verse is 4 ilis tendere! See Virg. Georg.

iii. 506, “imaque longo Ilia singulm ten-
dunt.” ‘Ilia ducsre’ is here to become
broken winded.

10. et versus et cetera ludicra poam]
He did not keep his word, for he wrote
much of the fourth Book of Odes and the
Carmen Saecularesster this; so thathe
says of himself (Epp- ii. l. 111) :—

“Ipse ego qui nullos me affirmo m'bm
Ingggg: Parthis mendsdor.”

4 Ludicra’ means the fomes of light posey.

“Singula de nobis snni praedentur euntes,
Eripuere jocos, venerem, convivia, ludium
Tendunt extorquere ροειιιιιιιι.η
