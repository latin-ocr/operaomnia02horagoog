Qun) fiee, Asterie, quem tibi candidi
Primo restituent vere Favonii

Thyna merce beatum,

Constantis juvenem fide,
Gygen? Ille Notis actus ad Oricum 5
Post insana Caprae sidera frigidas
Noctes non sine multis
’ Insomnis lacrimis agit.
Atqui sollicitae nuntius hospitae,

Suspirare Chloen et miser-am tuis

Dicens ignibus uri,

Tentat mille vesei- modis·
Ut Proetum mulier perfida credulum
Falsis impulerit criminibus nimis

2. Favonii] See C. i. 4. 1. Favonius,
according ιο Pliny (ii. 47), blew ⁶ ab occasu
aequinoctiali: that is, due west. Ῑι would
therefore be a favouruble wind for a vessel
coming down the Adriatic, and not very
nnfavourable for sailing up the west coest
of Italy. 11: would be in her tecth ss she
tried to make the struite of Messius.. But
Horace’s winde are not more stndied than
his places end persons. 'rho leveris waiting
tin the westher changes end the winde are
mild end favourable‚ end that is all Horace
means. The Favonii ure called ‘candidi’
us Notus and Iapyx are each called ‘ albus'
(C. i. 7. 153 iii. 27. 19).
4. flde‚] According ιο Aulus Gellius,

who bas devoted e chapter to the subject
ix. 14), the older forms of genitives of this

eclension were four,‘ es,' ‘,'ei ⁶i‚' and‘ e.’
Most of the MSS. have‘ {deff one of Bent-
ley’ s ‘fidiss u few‘ fide? which' ns generally
adopted now. “Munera laetitiamque dii''
is Heyne' s reading of Aen. i. 636. But in
Georg. i. 208 he reads‘ die’ for the geni-
tive. See Heyne' s end Wagn er' s observa-
tions on those pssoeges. Thynus and Bithy-
nus ure used indiam-iminstely by Horace.

5. Oricum] Thiswnsntowninssffirus,
situated st the top of tho bey formed by the
Aoeocersunian promontory. See Aen. x.
136: ‘Oricia terebintho? The conuelle-
tion ofthegreat Amalthea risesetthe be-
ginning of October.

13. mulier· perfida] Antea or Sthene-
baes. Smith’ s Dict. will give all
of the stories of Proetus end Peleus here
referred ιο. Some writers make Astydamin,
others Hippolyte, the wife of Acastus, who,
out of revenge for bis rejecnon of her, in-
duced her husband to expone Peleus ιο de-
struction. J oseph's virtue has its perallels
in Grecisn fable. Juvenal refers ιο them,

and adds,

Mulier saevissima tune eet
Cum stimulos odio pudor admovet?
