558 HORATII FLACOI

EPISTLE ΙΙ.

Something hae been said about M. Lollius, the consul, who wan defeated by the
Sigambri, in the Introduction to C. iv. 9, which ode was eddresaed to him probably on
the ocoeeion of his defeat, some time nster the writing of thie Epistle to his eldeet
eon, ae the person here addreeeetl is very generally supposed to be. The eighteenth
Epistle is written to the same person. There we leurn thet lollius was with Au-
gustus in the Cantabrian expedition, mmc- 729, and that he had a brother, to whom
some suppose the eighteenth Epietle was written. It is plain that the person here ud-
dreeued was young, and if he had been with the army he wne now prectising for the

and, ae Franke observes, it ie not likely that these grave views of life would be addi-med
to a boy who had not yet taken the ‘tog- virilis! 1 think there is much probability in
the date Franke suppones, mmo. 731, which would be e year aster Lollius' return from
Spain while he might yet be quite young: though when Frenke supporta his opinion by
the reference in v. 63 to gout and fomentatione, he only weekens his argument (see note).
Why Lollius is called Maximae in the first verse no one hae yet satisfactorily shown.
That he was the elder of two brothers, suppoeing that to have been the mee, would be
e bed reason for calling him Maximus. He would rather be called Major. But this ie
the opinion of most editors, and of Orelli among them. That he had the cognomen
Maximus is the explanation of othere. But there is no truce of such a cognomen in thia
family ι the only cognomen they ere known to have borne during the republic ie Polie-nm,
and the father os thie youth does not appear to have had any. Yonng lollius could not
have done any thing to guin himself euch a titleg and on the whole 1 am inclined to think
the word ia only a familiar half joculu· way of addressing hie young friend that Hence

Hor-oe has been ren-euhing himeelf with the cool bremen of Paene-te, and reading
Homer over again, end has been more than ever impreeeed, ae it would neem, with the
wiedom of hie poema and the moral and political leaeons they convey. This he makes
the foundation of a letter of advice, such as u young man just starting in life might find
uneful. What appears to have struck him most on his last peu-usal of the Iliad vae the
reckleee eelfiehneee of the leaders and their indifferenoe to the eufferingn their petty
aquabhlee occasione& while the Odys-ey he judgee to have been written with the in·
tention of representing a picture of patient and wine endunnce in the person of myssa,
as an example to all ages. Horace considere the value of the Homeric poema to lie in
the living picturae they present to the mind3 that they taught wisdom by exemplet. He
says nothing of the poetry end the artistic character of those compositione, in which their
real merit consiste. Aa u pieee of crificiam therefore Horaee's remark! are worth no-
thing. They are akin to the allegorical interpretation of Homer which treated his vorke
ae en inexhamtible sonutain of wiedom, and overlaid the critica with u fanciful view.
