preceded that wsr, she hsd not a poet of
distinction. Her public buildings, destroyed
by Xerxes, were replsced by others far
more splendid a few years ester the defeat
of the Pei-siens. Templa and theutes
were erected st enci-mous eost, and orna·
mented by the genius of Pheidiss and others
(architecte ond nuptura) of great renown.
The coincidence which, according to the
general belief, ”sociates the names of the
three great tragediam with the dete of
Salamis, marks thet dayes the commence-

Atheniens. With the prop-ess of the

possession of weelth rose the teste for liti-
getiou end habits of mangonem with
the thirst for knowledge came in the tesch-
ing of sophistry; end with political power
arose the passione of the &⁰9¹⁰ and the· ιιι-

argument against the favour-ers of the old
