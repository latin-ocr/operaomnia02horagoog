Dum studet urbanus tenditque disertus haberi.
Decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile; quodsi
Pallerem casu biberent exsangue cuminum.

Ο imitatores, servum pecus, ut mihi saepe

Bilem, saepe jocum vestri movere tumultus!

Libera per vacuum posui vestigia princepS,
Non aliena meo pressi pede. Qui sibi fidit

Dux regit examen.

Parios ego primus iambos

Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus

Archilochi, non res et agentia verba Lycamben.

25

Ac ne me foliis ideo brevioribus ornes

Quod timui mutare modos et carminis artem,
Temperat Archilochi Musam pede mascula Sappho,
Temperat Alcaeus, sed rebus et ordine dispar,

Nec socerum quaerit quem versibus oblinat atris,

Nec sponsae laqueum famoso carmine nectit.
Hunc ego non alio dictum prius ore Latinus

stomachum abrupit (?) dum 'I'imsgenem
et dicendo et pascendo amicos conatur ae-
quare.” Weichert (Poet. Lat. Rel. pp.
398, sq .) identifies Cordus with Virgil’s
landes aut jurgia Codn;” and vii. 26: “ in-
vidia rumpantur ut ilia Codril' The story,
as told by the Scholiasta, might easily be
made out of the text, and there is not much
reliance ιο be placed on their statements
when such is the case.

18. biberent exrauyue cuminum] ΤῙιο
fruit of this plant, which is a pleasant con-
diment, is desa-ibed by Pliny (xx. 15) as
giving a pallid hue to the complexion.
ver-ius also speaks of ‘⁴ pallentis grana
cumini ” (S. v. 56). Itis a plant of Eastcrn
origin. We are familiar with it through
the proverbial use of the name hy our Iaord
in his denunciation of the Pharisees, who
gave tithes of mint, auiae. aud cummin,
but neglected the weightier matters of the
law. It was used tc express littleness or
meanness in any shspe. Horace says, if
he happened to look pale by any cmnce,
his imitators would eat cummiu seeds to

23. Parios eqo primm iambos] The iam-
bics of Archilochus of Paros, who flourished
in the first half of the seventh century
n.c. (See A. P. 79.) As to his attacks upon
Lycambeo, see Epod. vi. 13, n. His daugh-
ters, who were included in Archilochus' in-
vectiva, and one of whom was betrothed

26. ne me soliis] ‘⁴ Ne minore corona
me decores ·“’ (Comm. Cruq.). Horace says
he is not ιο be blamed for imitating Archi-
lochus in his measure and the structure οἰ
his verse, for Alcaeus and Sappho did the
same; they tempered their Muse with the
measure of Archilochus. The iambics of
Archilochus are imitated by Horace in the
Epodes. Other mensures of his he has
imitated in the Odes. It is not so easy ιο
see stom the fragments that remain of the
three poets whereiu Sappho and Alcaeus
imitated Archilochus, who ssourished more
than half a century before them. There is
little left of Archilochus but his iambica.

'A greater variety of meta-cs is found in the

fragments of the other tw03 but how sar
the different messuras were invented or
modifled by them it is impossible to say.
Alcaeus wrote verses in what is called the
Sapphic metre, and Sappho in the Alcaic.
The style of Sappho’s fragments shows the
reason why Horace calls her ‘mascula.’
Tbere is a vigour about the language and
illustratione which goes beyond the ordinary
power of female passion, the delicacy οἰ
which nevertheless is not lost in the bold-
ness of its expression. It is impossible not
to see the working of intense feeling in
some even of the shortest fragments. (See
C. ii. 13. 24, n.
