Oorna vepres et pruna ferant, si quercus et ilex

Multa fruge pecus multa dominum juvet umbra,

Dicas adductum propius frondere Tarentum.
Fons etiam rivo dare nomen idoneus, ut nec
Frigidior Thracam nec purior ambiat Hebrus,
Infirmo capiti fluit utilis, utilis alvo.

Hae latebrae dulceS, etiam si credis amoenae,

15

Incolumem tibi me praestant Septembribus horis·
Tu recte vivis si curas esse quod audis.

J actamus jampridem omnis te Roma beatum3
Sed vereor ne cui de te plus quam tibi credas,

Neve putes alium sapiente bonoque beatum,

20

Neu si te populus sanum recteque valentem
Dictitet occultam febrem sub tempus edendi

Dissimiles, donec manibus tremor incidat unctis.

Stultorum incurata pudor malus ulcera celat.

Si quis bella tibi terra pugnata marique
