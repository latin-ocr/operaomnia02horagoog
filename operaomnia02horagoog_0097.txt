72 HORATII FLAOGI

CARMEN XXXIII.

The extant elegies properly attributed to Tibullus mention only two mista-esses of his,
under the names of Delia and Nemesis, and these are the only two that Ovid mentions in
the beautiful elegy he wrote on that poet’s death (Amor. iii. 9. 31, 55, sqq..) of the
person he calls Delia he was ensmoured during the earlier port os his life, of Nemesis
during his later years. (He died between thirty and foi-ty, about the same time as Vir-gil.)
Μυσὴ has been written to prove that the Glycera of this ode stands sor Delia (see parti-
cularly Spohn de A. Tibulli vita et earm. p. 50. 96, who believes that Delia, Nemesis,
Glycera, Neaera—a name oocurring only⁸ m the third book, which Tibullus it ι9 pretty
certain did not write, were 911 the same woman). Others have identified Glycera with
Nemesis, on aooount os the number and quantity of the syllables being the same, and the
epitheta Tibullus applies to her, ⁴ avara,' ⁴ rapm' ⁴ saeva? ⁴ dura,' which eoi-respond to
Horaoe's ⁴ immitis) Dissen is certain that Glycera is neither Delia nor Nemesis, bnt
another misnens otherwise unknown. Orelli is of the same opinion, but adds that thone
who thus attempt to settle to a nioety the loves of Roman gentionem and pretend to
know more about them than they have told us, only orente a smile among those who have
lived long in Franee or Italy,—implyiug that his countrymen were bad judgee of the
amusement· of their more gallant neighbours. It is not even eei-tuin that Tibullus wrote
the pitiful eleg-ies Horace speaks of. Glycera i· one of Horaee's favoni-ite names, and
cannot be taken for a real name here or elsewhere. It occurs in Plautus (Mil. Glor. ii.
5. 26); and Martini (xiv. 187). whether the person had any more reality than the nme
or the verses is 1 think doubtful. That Tibullus wrote elegies‚ that he m not rarely
erossed in love, and that he was on some occasion in a desponding humour, are faeta
sufficient to form a probable foundation for this good-tempered little poem. Whoever
goes further than this will find he is out of his depth.

Horace m much attached to Tibullus, who was a favoni-ite with his contemporaries.
To him was addressed the fourth epistle of the first book.

ARGUMENT.

Come, Albius, do not be drawling pitiful poeti-y upon Glycera, because she prefers a
younger man to you. Pretty Lycoris loves Cym, Cyrus inclines to Pholoe, who
admires the vulgar sinner as the she-goat loves the wolf. Such are Iove's diversione.

cruel than the 'aves of the Adriatic.
