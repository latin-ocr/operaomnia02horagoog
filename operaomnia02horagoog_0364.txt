ia Heindorf’a reading. Judging from Fea'a
list and Bentley’a assertiom the majority
of MSS. have Malchinua. That ia the read-
ing of Ven. (1483) and nearly all the earliest
editions. Bentley adopta it against Mal-
thium, which was the common reading at
that time. He derives it from Malchua,
which was an eastern name, or a corruption
of one. The Scholiasta unanimoualy say
that the name ia derived from μαλθακός·
