graphy of this name (for which the coined
name Nummidius has been substituted by
some to suit the occasion, and Fufidius by
others, from the next satire, v. 12) is decided
by Bentley from inscriptions and a passage
from Varro (de Re Rust. iii. 3), where one
of this name is mentioned, who Bentley
thinks may be Horace'a Ummidius. He
also considers that a man so rich must have
been very celebrated, and would not have
been spoken of as 4 a certain Ummidius ς’
and for this and other reasons he changes
4 quidam ' into ‘ qui tam' on his own con-
jecture, which no MS. has sanctioned, and
no editor but Fea that 1 am aware os has
adopted. It confines the sentence, and is
not wanted. As to the notoriety of the
person, if the story is true there is no reason
to think the name is that of the real hero of
it. The end of this worthy was that he was
murdered by one of his freed-women (his
mistress probably), who Horace says was
as stout-hearted as clytemnestra, the brevest
of her family. ‘Tyndaridarum' is masculine=
4 Tyndaridum' would be the feminine form.
The sons of Tyndarus, therefore, as well as
his daughters, must be included, aa Lam·
binus, Bentley, and others observe. ‘ Facias'
is equivalent to πράσσειν, 4 to fare!

97. adusque] Foreellini gives only two
other instanees of this word from writings of
Horace's day. Virgil (Aen. v. 262), 44 Mene·
laus adusque columnas Exsulst,'’ and Horace
himself (S. i. 5. 96), 44 adusque Bari moenia
piscosi.” It is only an inversion of ‘ usque
ad,’ 4 every step to.

1⁰1. ut vivam Maeniusl'] The con-
struction is the same as 44 discinctus aut
{fedam nepos ” (Epod. i. 34), where it has

n proposed to insert ‘ ut' before ‘ nepos'
(see note). Maenius and Nomentanus ap-
pear to have been squanderers of money and
good livera, according to the obvious mean·
ing of this passage, which the Scholiasta
mistaking make Maenius a sordid fellow
and Nomentanus a prodigal. They are
united again in S. i. 8. ll 3 ii. 1.21, where
the former appears under the name Panto·

labus, one who lays his hands on any thing
he can get, or borrows money from any
who will lend it. He spent his money and
turned parasite. This isin accordance with
what the Scholiasta Acron and Comm. Cruq.
affirm ou Epp. i. 15. 26 :—

44 Maenius ut rebus maternis atque paternis
Fortiter absu mptis.'’

But on S. i. 8. ll they tell a different story,
and say that the real name of Pantolabus
was Mallius, to which Acron and Porphyrion
add Verna, whether as a description or a
cognomen is uncertain. Comm. Cruq. for
‘Verna' has ‘Scurra.' It has been pro·
posed accordingly to change Maenius into
Mallius in the above Epistle. (Heusdius,
Studia Crit. in C. Lucilium, p. 230). But
we had better admit some confusion to exist
in the Scholiasts statements or text. Both
Maenius and Nomentanus are names used
by Lucilius sor characters of the same kind,
and Horace may very probably have only
borrowed the names to represent some living
characters whom he does not choose to point
out by their own names. Nomentanus
whom the Scholiasts on this passage <211

. Castus) was the name of one of the
guests at Nasidienus' dinner (S. ii. 8. 25),
and the Scholiasts tell us a story of the his·
torisa Sallust hiring his cook for an enor-
mous sum of money. Cruquius’ Commen-
tator (on the passage last quoted) says he
was a ‘decumanus,' one who farmed the
4 decumae,' and therefore an 4 eques ’ (see
Cic. in Verr. Act. ii. l. 2. c. 71, and 1. 3. c. 6,
Long's notes). He appears again S. ii. 3.
224, sqq. Seneca (de Vit. be. c. 11) com-
pares one of this name with Apicius.
Maenius the Scholiasts have confounded
with him in whose honour the Maenia
columna was raised, C. Maenius, the con-
queror of the Latius (Livy, viii. 13). Some
of the old MSS. have Naevius for Maenius.
Cruquius and Fea have that reading.
