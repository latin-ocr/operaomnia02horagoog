Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo

HORATII FLAOGI

35

Imploravit opes hominis frenumque recepit3
Sed postquam victor violens discessit ab hoste
Non equitem dorso, non frenum depulit ore.
Sic qui pauperiem veritus potiore metallis

Libertate caret, dominum vehit improbus atque

Serviet aeternum, quia parvo nesciet uti.
Oui non conveniet sua res, ut calceus olim,
Si pede major erit subvertet, si minor uret.
Laetus sorte tua vives sapienter, Aristi,

Nec me dimittes incastigatum ubi plura

45

Cogere quam satis est ac non cessare videbor.
Imperat aut servit collecta pecunia cuique,
Tortum digna sequi potius quam ducere funem.
Haec tibi dictabam post fanum putre Vacunae,

Excepto quod non simul esses caetera laetus.

37. Sed postquam victor violem] Bout-
ley‚ not liking ⁶ violens ⁹ in this connexion,
has changed ‘victor’ into ‘vietel and put
⁶ violens' before it. Thoee is no authority
for the change. The reading of the text is
that os every ΜΒ. and the Scholiasta, and

39. potiore metallis] The ⁶ vectigalia'
bom minoe (⁶ metalla ') wem very consider-
able at this time. The principal mines were
the gold of A uileia and Ictimuli in the
Alps, and the s' ver of Spain.

42. ut calcem olim] See S. i. 3. 31, n.
⁸ olim’ is used quite indefinitely, asin S. i.

instances of ⁶ urere‚' ⁴ to gauf see Porcell.

48. Thr-tum diqna sequi] Acron says,
⁴⁴ Qui magis vinci debet ε quoniam vinci est
trahi non trahereJ’ 1 think this gives the
right sense, and that the metaphor is not
taken from machina, or rope-dancing, or
haltere, or dog-chains, or boys pulling at

Vacunae was about three miles from the
confluence of the Digentia and the Anio
closeto the medem town, RoccaGimane.
⁴⁶ Vacuna has been thought by some com·
ment-tontobothogodde-orffime.
Lilius Gis-aldus says it is synonymus with
Minerva, Varro with Victoria. The opi-
nion of the last seems confirmed by the
following inscription found near the tem-

A prostrate brick wall covered with cernent,
and the portion of a small conduit, which
supplied the temple with water, were all
that we could find of the ‘ fanum
Vacunae ⁹ '⁹ (Kelsall’s Classiml Excursion
from Rome to Arpino, p. ⁴21, london, 1821).
Vacuna was originally a Sabine goddess.
Some suppose that Horace is playing upon
the name, as if it were akin to Vaoetio, to
which notion 1 attach no velue.
