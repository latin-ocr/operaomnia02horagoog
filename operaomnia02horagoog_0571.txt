546 HORATII FLAOGI

ARGUMENT-

Maecenas, more honoured than 011 the world, 1 heve received my dischar303 seek not to
coll me back 3 my years 01111 1117 inclinatione are not what they were. Let me hang up
my 011110 and retire. A werning voice within bids me loose the nged steed lest he
stumble st the end of his course. Vei-se 1 107 sside, 01111 turn 011 1117 thoughts to
philosophy 01111 virtue, end 0111 lsying up stores of these.

(v. 13.) 1 belong, if you ask me, to 110 school, 01111 own no master, but 0111 borne along
when-ever the breeze may set: now 011 activity 01111 virtue with the Stoioe, now insen-
sibly falling into the laxity of Aristippus. The days are weery till 1 shall have learnt
to act out what neither rich nor poor, young nor old, 0011 neglect with impunity.
meantime 1 een only take the little knowledge 1 have for my guide 01111 comfort. Π
we cannot resch pei-fection, we may sdvance towards it. There ere chel-ms in philosophy
for every discsse. Ambition, envy, passion, eloth, intempernnce, lusu—all that is most
ssvsge 11107 be tsmed if it turn 0 willing ear to instruction. The first step in vix-me
01111 wisdom is to 0001111011 vice 01111 10117. For instance, you who are hastening to be
rich, end flying from the disgnee of poverty, will you not lenm from the wise to
despise those things you love so foolishly ? Would the boxel· who fights in the streets
despise the Olympio crown which should be offered him without 0 blow?

(v. 62.) Believe me virtue is above the worth of gold, though the whole Forum 11107 say
otherwise, 01111 0111 and young may leam the lesson, crying, ⁴ Money first 01111 then
virtue.¹ Be able, good, eloquent, honest, es you will, let your property fau short but
by 0 little of the equestrisn 01111 7011 are nobody. Never mind ς the children will 0011
7011 King if you do well. Let this be your stronghold, 0 conscience void of offence.
Which is best, Roscius' law 01· the boys’, which the good old soldiers Curius and
Camillus approved Ξ Which is your best sdviser, he who bids you get money how you
cun, that you 11107 sit 0 little nem-er the stege, or he who stands ever st your elbow 01111
bids end oesches you to defy the caprices of Fortune?

(v. 70.) Αι111 is 1 be asked why I hold not the opinions of the world 1 mix with, my
snswer is that which the 1οκ mede to the lion: because I see 011 the footmsrks ται-11011
towards your den 01111 none the other wey. Whom or what 0111 Ι to follow? One 111011
is getting rich by one foul wsy 01111 another by another, and no one is 00th even
with himself. A 111011 takes 0 fancy to build on the coast st Baiae, the next 1107 he is
off inland to Teanum. If he is married he wishes himself 0 bachelon if not- he wishes
he was, And even the poor msn, he must change his ledgings and his fui-nitore, and
hire himself 0 bost to ape the rich msn’s yacht.

(v. 94.) And 7011 too my friend, you 1011ςο st me if the barber 1100 cut my hair awry, or
if my vest is 0110007 while my tunic is fine: but graver inconsisteneies you cure not fot.
In respect of these you think 1 0111 but ns mad 00 1117 neighbours 01111 want no gun-dian,
01111 this though you 010 my protector 01111 are vexed with me for the emollest neglect
of my body, 01111 though 1 look to you 01111 hang upon you like 0 child.

(v. 106.) 111 short, to go back. The wise 111011 is only inferior to great Jove,—-rich, free,
respected‚ hnndsome, and 0 king of kings3 but above 011 sound except when his σῶαι-,011
is out of order.
