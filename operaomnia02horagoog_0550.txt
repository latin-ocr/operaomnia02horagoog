SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 7. 525

SATIRE VII.

The substance of this Satire Horace puts into the mouth of his slsve Davus, giving
him liberty to express himself ss he pleases on the day of the Sutrii-ndis, when much
lieence was granted to slaves in particulas. Davus takes sdvantage of the permission
given him to sbuse his master, end to tsunt the rich with a slavery (to their passione sud
to the world) hardel· end more stupid than his own. He also teunts Horace with his
instability and weakness of purpose, which part of the Satin-e appears to me to be the
most natural end amusing (see note on v, 23). The rest contains a great deal that is
dissgreesble and much that is common-place. It may perhaps represent the habit of
talking trash under the name of philosophy, which those who pretended to be of the Stoic
school had established, and the humour would be more perceptible ιο a Roman of the
day than it is now. The commentator-s speslt highly of its wit, but most of them make
little distinction, and preise all elike.

There is no truce of a date in the Satire, but some think it probable thet es S. 3 was
written at one Saturnalia, and this makes mention of the same festival, end touches like
the other upon Stoic doctrines, it wss perhaps written a yesr ester the above. 1 do not
see any force iu this, nor does it appear neoesssry to suppose the Satin-e was written at or
near the Saturnalia. That way of introducing the subject might heve suggested itself at
any time of the year.

ARGUMENT.

Ι have been long a listener, O my master, and though Ι long to say s few words, 1 know
my position, and am afraid.

10 that Davus? ¹

Even so, Davus your indifferent good slave.

Well, it’s the Saturnalia: you may spesk.

There ere some men who are consistent in viceg others who are always hovering between

. right and wrong. There’s Priscus, a man who changes every hour from the fop to the
plain man, from the stately to the humble, from the rske to the philosopher, the very
type of mutability. While Volanerius the gumester, when he could no longer hold the

. dice-box for the gout, hired s boy to do it for him. But he in his consistency was
better off than the other man in his inconsistency.

To you.

What do you menn, scoundrel ἓ

Why you profess to preise the good old times, but wouldn't go back to them if you
might. In the town you pine for the country, in the country you cry up the town.
If you are not invited out you pretend you ere glad ιο stay st home ς if sn invitation
comes, off you fly and leave your poor guests in the lurch3 gluttons they are no doubt,
but are you less so yourself?

Suppose Ι should prove that you are sillier even than me your slave? Don't be engi-y,
and 1 will tell you what 1 have picked up at the philosopher's.

This man goes aster his neighbour's wife, Ι aster a common woman, which of us deserves
most to be hanged? Ι incur no disgrsce sud no danger. You sre obliged ιο put on
all sorte of disguises, trembliug with a mixture of lust end ἕω. Why you might es
well go hire yourself for a gladiator as submit ιο be tucked into a box to escape un
