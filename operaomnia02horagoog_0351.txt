Momento cita mors venit aut victoria laeta.''
Agricolam laudat juris legumque perime,

Sub galli cantum consultor ubi ostia pulsat.

spoilt by such e process. (See above, C. ii.
„ 18. 23, n.) What Orelli says, that iu Cicero
the formula 4 qnid enim ' is always followed
by another question, only shows how little
necessity there is for interrupting the sen·
tence as he does, by an interrogation after
those words. Fea’e reading, 4 qnid ni ξ’
which was su to Lambinus by a
friend of his, end which he liked, but sup·-
posed it to want authority. which has since
been supplied by four of Fea's MSS„ is as
bad as possible. Acron hes the following
note “quid enim: quare non= et est co-
micum,' from which it is infer-red his rend-
ing was 4 quidni ἓ ' Whether that be so or
not, the reading is a bsd one. 4 Horae
momento ’ is a common phrase in Livy and
other writers. Horace hes below 4 puncto
mobilis horse! 4 Punctum ¹ is perhaps a
little more precise than ‘ momentum,' which
significa the progress of time, though con-
ventionally its smnllest division. Pliny
drsws a distinction between them (Panegy.
iv. c. 56): 44 quod momentum, quod immo
temporis punctum aut beneficio sterile aut
vacuum laude ἓ ”

8. Memento cita more venit] lambinus,
on the authority of four of his MSS„ but
against sll the best, reads ‘ momento sut
cita ς’ and Bentley follows him, seying,
that without the disjunctive perlicle the
reading is 44 ominosum plene et infaustum.”
Heindorf puts in the particle, but 1 think it
is better omitted. It gives too much pre-
cision to the sentence, considering the posi-
tion of the speaker, ns Reisig observes.

9. ,iuris legumque peritus,] 44 Juru debat
legesque viris '⁹ (Aen. i. 507). 44 Haec nos
juris, legum, urbium societati devinxit '’
(Cic. de N. D.l. ii. c. 59 . On the distinc-
tion between 4 leges' sn 4 jus ' see Smith's
Dict. Ant„ article 4 Jus,' and Mr. Long’s
Excursus on Edicta Megistrstuum (Cic. in
Verr. p. 165). Cicero (de Orat. i. 48) thus
defines a jurisconsultus: 44 Sin autem quee-
reretur quisnam jurisconsultus vere nomi-
naretur, eum dicerem qui legum et consue·
tudinis ejus qun privati in civitate uterentur,
et ed respondendum et ed egendum (Er-
nesti hes 4 scribendum ’) et ad cavendum
peritus esset3 et ex eo genere Sex. Aelium,

M. Manilium, P. Mucium nominarem.
The seme M. Manilius he says (in the seme
treatise, lib. iii. c. 33) he has seen 44 trans-
verso ambulantem foro, quod erat insigne
eum qui id feceret facere civibus omnibus
consilii eui copiam3 ad quos olim et ita
ambulantes et in solio sedentes domi sic
adibatur, non solum ut de jun civili ed eos,
verum etism de filia collooenda, de fundo
emendo, de egro colendo, de omni denique
sut officio, eut negotio, referi-emt? The
same he says vves the practice of P. Crassus,
Ti. Coruncanius, and Scipio, all Pontifices
Maximi, who gave their advice on the Jus
Pontificium end matters not only of law
but of private interest, on questions humen
and divine. At the time Horace wrote,
the J us ndendi, whatever it meent
(see Puchte, i. 559. lst ed. lust„ and art.
‘Jurisconsultus,' Smith’s Dict. Ant), was
not established, end the number of those
who gave legal advice was probably large,
but they were always distinct from the
professore or tenebere, ‘advoceti,' end
others, who vere puid for their services,
and from 4 ommes: though the 4 consultus '
sometimes combined with his calling ss
such that of the 4 orator ' or 4 pan-onus? which
is included in the word ‘ agere) used by
Cicero above. If we are to believe this
statement of Hor-nce, und another to the
seme effect (Epp. ii. 1. los),

44 Romae dulce diu fuit et sollenne reclusa
Mane domo vigilare, clienti promens jurass’

end thst of Cicero (pro Mun-en. c. 9 ,
“ Vigiles tu (thet is, Sulpicius Severus) e
nocte ut tuis consultoribus respondeum ille
(thet is, Lucullus) ut eo quo intendit cum
exercitu perveniat3 te gallorum, illum bucm'-
nurum centus exsuscitet,”-we mustsuppose
thet these learned persons, who gave their
‘response’ gratuitously, sacrificed their own
convenience to the anxiety of their cliente,
und received them st a very early hour in
the morning. On ‘laudnt' see v. 3, n.
