CARMEN XXXV.

nane. 728.

When Augustus was meditating an expedition against the Britons and another for the
East, Horace commended him ιο the care of Fortune the presel-ver, as Pindar committed
the sous‘of Himera:

Δι’σσομαι, παῖ Ζηνὸς Ἐλευθερίου,

Ἱμέραν εὐρυσθένέ ἀμφιπόλει, Σώτειρα Τύχα·

τὶν γὰρ ἐν πόντῳ κυβερνῶνται θοαὶ

νᾶες, ἐν χέρσῳ δὲ λαιψηροὶ πόλεμοι

κάγοραὶ βουλαφόροι. (Olymp. xii.)
Which passage probably Horace had in mind. The last expedition against Britain con-
templated by Augustus was A. n. ο. 728 (Dion Cass. 53. 25), which was interrupted by an
insurrection of the Salassians, an Alpine people‚ ἐς τὴν Βρεταννιαν ἐπειδὴ μή ἠθέλησαν
ὁμολογῆσαι στρατευσείοντιι κατέσχον oi Σαλάσσιοι. At the same time he was preparing
the force that was ιο conquer Arabia (see C. 29 of this book). Το this year therefore
the composition os this ode may be assigned.

The oldest temples of the goddess Fortune were at Rome, where we leat-n from
Plutarch (on the Fortune of the Romans, c. x.). τὰ τῆς Τύχης ἱερὰ πάμπολλα-καὶ παλαιὰ
καὶ λαμπρὰ τιμαῖς πάσαις ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ἐνίδρυται καὶ cas-apiacam τοῖς ἐπιφανεστά-
τοις μέρεσι καὶ τόποις τῆς πόλεως. The oldest of her temples was dedicated to Fortuna
Virilis by neus Martius (Plutarch says). There was another to Fortuna Muliebris,
founded in commemoration of the victory of Coriolanus' mother over her son; and
Servius Tullius founded two on the Capitoline hill to Fortuna Primigenia and Fortuna
obsequens: on the Palatine hill there were two ιο Fortuna Privata and Fortuna viscosa.
There was also a Fortuna virginalis and a Fortuna Bonae Spei, a Fortuna Mascula,
ἄλλαι τε μύριαι Τύχης τιμαὶ καὶ ἐπικλήσεις ὦν τᾰς πλείστας Σεροῦἳος κατέστησεν,
εἰδὼς ὅτι μεγάλη ῥοπὴ, μᾶλλον δὲ ὅλον, ἡ Τύχη παρὰ πάντα ἐστὶ ra* τῶν ἀνθρώπων
πράγματα. But the worship of this goddess was most solemnly maintained, when
Horace wrote, at Praeneste and at Antium, where she had an oracle. The Roman concep-
tion of this divinity was probably different from that of the Greeksss who thought of her
chiefly as a caprieious goddess and blind. But that such was not the only idea of her
even among the Greeks is plain from Pindar's ode above quoted. Pindar in other poema
now lost described her as φερέπολις, the supporter os states ς also as one of the Μοῖραι,
and the most powerful of them3 but elsewhere as ἀπευθὴς, uncertain, unknown3 in
which character casual altars were erected to her by the Greeks as ἄγνωστος θεός.
See St.Pau1’s address ιο the Athenians in Acts xvii. 233 also Pausanias, iv. 30·
vii. 26· and Plutarch’ s Treatise above mentioned, eaps. 4 and lo. From Plutarch’ a
account she would appear ιο be the one divinity held from the earliest times in reputo
by the Romans. How far Horace may have drawn the attributes and attendants
