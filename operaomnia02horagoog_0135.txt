CARMEN XII.

The Scholiast Acron οιι Sat. i. 2. 64 has collected from Horace instancee of fictifious
names put for real ones os the same number of syllables of the same quantity· as Licinia
(so all the Scholiasta write the name) for Terentia. Malthinue for Maecenae‘ ιιι the 25th
verse of the above Satire3 and Velliua for Annius in the 6⁴th. Bentley quotes Persius
(Sat. i. 121) = ‘⁴ Auriculas asini Mida rex habet,” where Mida stands sor· Nero. He
also quotes from Apuleius a number of instancee gethered from Catullus, Tibullus, Pro-
pertius, and Ticida, whom Ovid mentione (Triet. ii. 437 eq.) in conj uuction with other poete
as disguising the name of Metella under the fictitioua one os Perille. To theee may be
added Canidia, substituted it would seem for Gratidia by Horace. Asauming, then, that
Licymnia repraeente Terentia (and not a mistress of Horace, as some commentatore aup-
pose, and Acron inconsistently suggesta aa au alternatiou for Terentia), the date of the
ode may be conjectured. Maecenas was married to Terentia about A.u.c. 721 οι· 722
(Epod. iii.), and ahe must have been iu the prime of her beauty when this ode was
written. But the reference ιο Augustue' wara, especially in the verses “ ductaque per vias
Regum colla minacium,” makes it almost certain that it was not written before his triumph
in the month Sextilis, Α.υ.ο. 7 25. Βιιι the harmony between Maecenas and his wife was
not of long continuance= therefore it ie probable the ode was written soon aster the
triumph. That Augustus ia called Caesar (v. 10) seems to thke ιο make it probable
