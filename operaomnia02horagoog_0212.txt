GARMEN XIX.

The impetuosity sud liveliness of this ode are remarkable. It would be difficule ιο find
in nny languege, 1 think, s poem more expressive oi* the freedom suited to the occasion
for which it was composed, —e supper in honour of Murens's installation in the college
of angui-s. In regnrd to this person see C. ii. 2, end 10. Telephus is no doubt s fictitious
nume. though Acron culis him a Greek poet und s friend of Horace, being led to that
informetion ss is common with· commentatore, old und modern, only by the ode itself, ιο
which undue reelity is given. The neme occurs in two other odes (i. 13 and iv. 11), and
efforts have been made ιο prove the person ιο be the semein ench cese. In the first of
these he is a “ puer furens ” with “ cervix rosen '' end “ ceree brachis,” with whom Lydis
is passionately in love. Here he is a bookworm given to antiquarien end historicul re-

Phyllis his last love. ‘⁸ Modern commentatore heve filled up the details of the (Scholiest's)

und when he is once buried in them is hardly to be torn away from his books, with more
of the seme idle bebble. Those good old scholnrs, Gersrd Vossius end· Fabricius, never
