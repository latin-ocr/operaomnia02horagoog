SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 1 .

Imperet hoc natura potens, sic collige mecum z
Dente lupuS, cornu taurus petit: unde nisi intus
Monstratumi Scaevae vivacem crede nepoti

Matrem3 nil faciet sceleris pia dextera: mirum,

Ut neque calce lupus quemquam neque dente petit bos3

Sed mala tollet anum vitiato melle cicuta.

Ne longum faciam: seu me tranquilla senectus
Exspectat seu Mors atris circumvolat alia,

Quisquis erit vitae scribam color.''

Frigore te feriat.'' “Quid, cum est Lucilius ausus

follows it is Horace’s purpose to show that
it is a law of nature that every one should
use the means of defence that are given
him, and he· is only acting on this law when
he employa satire in sels-defence. ‘'Unde
inv. 52 belongs to‘ ιιιοιιοιπῐιιιιιβ asinthe,
next Satire, v. ει’31, “Unde datum σιειιιιιο.η
Some punctuate the words‘ unde, nisi intus
monstratum 3’ so as to mean ‘how should

says he was a luxui-iona liver, and poisoned
his mother because she lived longer than
he liked, which we may learn from the text
without his help. Acron says he was given
to mag-ic arta ς· and Porphyrion quotes by

‘⁸ Libertus patronum non occidit sed duobus
digitulis gulam oblisit.” What Horace
says is, that Scaeva, like other animala,
resorted to the means most natural to him,
which were not cold steel, to which eowards
have an aversion, but poison. ⁴ Mirum, ut

58. seu Mors atris circumvolat alin]
The representatione ,of Death in the ποι-1η
of art that have come down to us are very
few, as might be expected. From medals,
coins. seals, ring-s, acc.. the figure of Death
would be banished‚ as Spence says (Poly-
metis‚ p. 260), because it would be unsuit-
able and of ill omen3 and of ancient pic-
turee we have few remaining. In those
probably the representatione of the poets
were copied, or those which we find in the
poeta are copied from them, and this of
death hovering over a man with dark wings
looks very like the representation of a

pointing. Senem desoeibes Death with
many wingsz
‘⁴ Mors alta avidos oris hiatus

Pandit et omnes explicat alas.”
(Oedipus, Acti. chor.)

60. Quisquis erit vitae scribam colon]
This loose collocation of words ia not un-
oommon in Horace. 1 do not know what
force he saw in it, but he must have pre-

ferred it.
— Ο puer, ut eis] See Introduction.

This sentence illustrates the rule respecting
verbs of sear-ing, that they “have the sub-
junctive with· ne’ if the object be not
desired. with⁴ ut’ if it be desired'' (Key's
L. G. 1186), to which the note is‘ ‘observo
that the Latin inserte a negative where the
English has none, and vice versa.” Persius
has imitated this passage (S. i. 1⁰7)=

Each of the Scipiones had a Laelius for his
