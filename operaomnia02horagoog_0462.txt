ὓ Q. HORATII FLAool

SATIRARUM

‘ LIBER SECUNDUS.

SATIRE Ι.

C. Tanna-rius Tasra was a jurisconsult of eminence and a man of honour. He was in
the confideuce of Augustus, and was consulted by him on legal matters (see the notice of
him in Dict. Biog.). Horace seems ιο have been well acquainted with him, though he
was many years younger than Trebatius, and it is said that he was dead when this Satire
was written. 1 am inclined to doubt this, for though it is possible Horace may have used
the old man’s name though he was dead, it is more natural to suppose that he did so
when he was alive. The Satire is placed by the chronologists after all the others of the
second book. Franks argues from the allusion in v. 15 ιο the Parthians, that it must have
been written in A.u.c. 724, when, aster the battle of Actium, Augustus was in Asia
settling the affairs of the East (see C. i. 26, Int.). 1 think this is a weak foundation for
his assumption. As 1 have said before, the conquest of the Parthians was a subject the
Romans of this period had continually before them, and to allude to the wounds of the
Parthian prostrate on the field of battle (⁴‘ aut labentis equo describat vulnera Parthi '’)
would have been more natural at almost any time than when Augustus was carrying on
peaceful negotiatione with that people, without any immediate intention or prospect of
coming ιο blows with them. That the Satire was written after the eighth of the first book
is plain, because a verse is repeated from that poem in this (v. 22). Horace writes how-
ever as if he were just beginning his career (v. 6⁰), a ἀπο full of the impulsos of youth,
and resisting the superior wisdom of his elder. As this is done only to keep up a little
humour in the scene, no particular inference as to time can be drawn fiom it. Because
Caesar is called ⁶ invictus ' (r. ll), Kirchner supposes the Satire could not have been
written till aflzer the death of M. Antonius and the final establishment of Augustus'
power. He therefore assumes the date A.u.c. 726, which Ι believe to be much too late.
Horace pretends to lay before the old lawyer a case for his opinion, and asks what he
had better do ιο meet the malevolence of his enemies. Trebatius advises him ιο cease
from writing, which Horace says is impossible. He was bom to write, and must do it.
He hm no capacity for heroic subjects, and has a passion for imitating Lucilius, ιο whom
‘ he pays a graceful compliment by the way. Trebatius warns him that he runs the risk of
being frozen to death by his great friends, or of legal penalties for libel. But trusting in
the goodness of his cause he sets these dangers at defiance, and resolves ιο indulge his
inclination. It is not easy ιο suppose that a satire written in this stu-ain was quite the
last that Horace composed3 and it might be supposed, not unreasonably, that it followed
at no great distance of time the eighth of the first book, from which Trebatius quotes and
not from any in the second book, from which he might as easily and more naturally have
quoted if they had been written at the time3 for that they were published as soon as
written, and not for the first time when they were collected in books, is sufficiently evident.
