HORATII FLAGOI

Aut positum ante mea quia pullum in parte catini
Sustulit esuriens, minus hoc jucundus amicus

Sit mihi?

Quid faciam si furtum fecerit, aut si
Prodiderit commissa fide sponsumve negarit!

Quis paria esse fere placuit peccata laborant

Cum ventum ad verum est; sensus moresque repugnant
Atque ipsa utilitas, justi prope mater et aequi.

Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terrie,

Mutum et turpe pecus, glandem atque cubilia propter

100

Unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque ita porro
Pugnabant armis quae post fabricaverat usne,
Donec verba quibus voces sensusque notarent
Nominaque invenere ς dehinc absistere bello,

Oppida coeperunt munire et ponere legoe,

105

Ne quis fur esset, neu latr0‚ neu quis adulter.
Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus teterrima belli
Causa, sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi,

Quos venerem incertam rapientes more ferarum

Viribus editior caedebat, ut in grege taurus·

110

J ura inventa metu injusti fateare necesse est,
Tempora si fastosque velis evolvere mundi.

95. commista-fide] This ia a form both
of the genitive and dative. See C. iii. 7. 4:
⁴⁴ Constantis juvenem fide.”

96. Quis paria euefere] This common
doctrine of the Stoice ie noticed by Cicero
(de Pin. iv. 19) and condemnedy on the
Ξῗὲῴᾞξὲῃῗωοέἰ..ῗί.ῗῑ.ῗὶᾶιῗῖἒὲ“ωέ
In making expediency the parent of justice,
or something like it (⁴ prope ⁹), Horace
follows an Epicurean notion. One of Ep i·
curus ’s dogmas appears to have been that
Justice was nothing by itaeli', but merely a
eocial com by which men bound them-
selves ιο agian stom· injuring one another.
(Diog. lauert. x. 150. ) Nan-ow and eub-
jective as this view of the case may be, it is
not worse than that which, under the aanc-
tion os a popular name, has been long
taught for moral philosophy at one of our

102. usum] Here thie significa ⁴ need! It
generally occure (in this senae) in combina-
tion with⁴ est’ οι· ‘venitss ‘Verba nomina·
que 'conventionally embraces all the parte

of speech, like tho Greek ὀνόματα καὶ
ῥήματα. ‘'Notae are symbola, as in short-

hand writing for insoenceg and thie line
may perhaps be most accurately rendered,
⁴ till they invented language whereby they
could give a symbolical form ιο the eonnds
of their voice and ιο their feelings!

111. Jura inventa metu injusti] If thia
be admitted, as of course it must be, then
Injustice, and if eo J natica was anterior
to any lawe or social compact, expiens or
implied, so that the ‹locu-ine above laid
down falls to the ground, and that justice
of which ex pediency ie said ιο be the
mother turns out ιο be nothing more than
magistrates’ judicer-the justice of etatum.
which may be just or unJust. The philo-
sophy that would visit all offences, great
and small, with the same condign penalty,
is abun-<h but he who affirma that lying is
lying, theft is thest, lust is luet, in whatever
form or degree, or in whatever person it
appears, says ιιο more than that fire is fire.
οι· water ia water, whether we take a vol-
cano οι· a ruehlight to represent the one,
an ocean or a bucketful to represent the
other.

112. evolvere] This word, which significa

‘to read,' ia taken from the unrolling of a
parchment ⁴ unque ad umbilicum. ’ See
Epod. xiv. 8, ιι.
