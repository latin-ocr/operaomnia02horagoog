SATIRARUM Ι. 4.

Hinc omnis pendet Lucilius, hosce secutus
Mutatis tentum pedibus numerisque, facetus,
Emunctae naris, durus componere versun.
Nam suit hoc vitiosus: in hora saepe ducentos

Ut magnum versus dictabat stans pede in uno,

Cum flueret lutulentus erat quod tollere vellee;

true, would make the allusione equally in-
telligible end more ridiculous. Neither of
these psephisms lested more theu s couple
of years. See S. i. 6. 14, ιι, on ⁸ notare!

Β. Hinc omnis pendet Lucilium] ‘ Hinc’
means ⁴ upon them,' ss ‘unde' is elsewhere
used with reference to persons. What
Horace says of Lucilius in brief is this:
thst his whole strength was isid out on the
nurizing of vice in the persone of living
chettaei-⁸3 thst he especially imitated here·
in the writers of the Old eomedy, only
chsnging their meu-eg thot he was funny
eud mute, but hsrsh in his style of versi.
ficationg wordy end sometimes vulger, in
consequence of the haste with which hs
wrote and his impsuenoe of the trouble of
eorrecting. Familinr ss Horace must hsve
been with Lucilius’ writings, this description
may be taken ss s. correct one. It beu-s
sci. onthefsceofitusfsresitgoes‚
for the criticism touchee only the surfuce,
sud the critic could not be mistekeu, snd is
not to be supposed to heve lied. Iu fect he
says below (S. 10. 3) the most idolutrous
admirer of Lucilius could not deny the truth
of his statement, that his style wss uncouth.
He there slso adds thot Lucilius loved to
ἲίᾘῧξ, ‘33121022233‘2032233 me..
withsteuding his satiricel vein (v. 53). aud
again that he was very unreserved end frunk
(S. ii. 1. 30—-34). This is vsluable teeti-
mony ss to the character of Lucilius end
his writings; end ss other writers heve
neither added much to it nor successfully
impugned it, sud since the fragments of
Lucilius thet heve come down to us are
too short to form u very accurate opinion
upon, but in some points et least (such ss
the sbsmd mixture of Greek end Letin)
bear out Horace’s statements, we may con-
sider this satire sud the others ee useful
contributions to the history of Romen
literature.

7. Mutatio tantum pedibus] The writings
of Ludlius appear to have been very early
divided by the gremmeriens into thirty
books, of which two-tbirds were written in
hexameter verse. sud the rest in the iambic
sud trochsic messuros.

8. Emunctae naris,] ‘⁴ Significat sspi-
cntem quin e conunrio muugosum stultum
appellemus ’³ (Acron). Porphyrion takes the
words with ⁶ venus! sud explsins them to
nguify ‘⁴ elegantes et decentes ;” the error
therefore of Fscciolsfi noticed by Orelli was
not original. ⁶ Mungosus,' Acron’s word,
is not found in the lexicons. ⁰ Emunctse
nsris’ is one who hss his note well wiped,
eud is therefore no driveller. Phsedrus
texplains ἧς in his description of Aesop, (1. iii.

. 3, v. 14 2—-

“ Aesopus ibi stans ueris emunctae senex,
Nature nunquam verbu cui poterit dere. ”

‘Emungere’ is used by the comic writers
for ‘ eheeting‚' ss among other places (see
Foroell.) in the fragment from the Epiclerus
of Caecilius quoted by Cicero de Am.

·‘ Hodie mc unte omnes comicos stultns

vAEfftque emunxeris hutissime.”

‘⁶ Το wipe a msn’s noee for him, is to imply
thst he is s driveller who cannot do it for
himself, sud hence it means to ‘outwit' snd
to ⁴ chest' him'' (Long in loco). Others
explain ‘ emunctae nurie' ss ‘keen scented,’
like s houud·

10.- verm dictabat] See S. 10, 92, n.
The words ⁶ stsus
the utmoet fiadlity,’ or ⁶ standing st esse,’
ss we might say. Heindorf compares the
expreoeion with the Greek proverbisl phrases
ὅλῳ ποδί, ἐκ δυοῖν ποδοῖν, ἀμφοῖν ποδοῖν,
meaning with ull one’s might3 the first of
which is quoted by Quintilian us s rustic
seying (xii. 9. fin.)= “ Itaque in his actioni-
bus omni, ut agricolae dicunt, pede standum
est.'’ Others explain ⁴ stans pede in uno '

11. Gumflueret lutulentus] ⁸ Lutulen-
tus ’ is explniued by Acronus ‘⁸ sordidus 3 cui
contrarium luculentus‚” which explsuetion
combine· two notions,dirtiness und obscurity.
Lucilius moy heve imitsted the obscenity of
the old comediuns3 end iu this, ss in other
respects, his verse moy heve been like s
muddy stream. The word, no doubt, com-

pedeinuno’ mesu ‘with .
