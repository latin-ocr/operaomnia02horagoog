cure his appearance before the r at a
time agreed upon between the plaintiff and
himself. If he did not appear, he forfeited
the amount of the ⁴ vadimonium ' or -
ment, and his ⁶ vades ’ were liable to pay it
ir he did not. (See S. 9, n.). The per·
son here represented, therefore, is the de-
fendant in an action going up reluctantly
to Rome, to appear before the Praetor
according te his agreement. ‘ 1116 ’ is as if
the man were before ns.

14. Delaesare valent] Though “tielasso ’
(1666 not occur elsewhere, there is no reason
ω suspect the word or alter it. The in-
tensive soree of ⁴ de ¹ is well added to
‘ lasso! It nds to κατά, which has
the same force. By making ‘ adeo sunt
multa ’ parenthetical, the construction ia
plain. who Fabius was, it is impossible
even to conjecture with probability. Acron
says of him that he was a Roman ⁸ equee' of
Narbo, who wrote some books on the Stoic
philosophy3 that he was of Pompeius'
party, and that he osten disputed with
Horace, whence he calls him ⁴ loquax ς’
which looks very like an invention derived
from the text. Porphyrion and Cruquius'
Commentator both tell the same story,
and the former gives him the cognomen
Maximus. Supposing him to be the
Fabius we meet with below (2. 134), all
the additional knowledge we get of him is,
that he was a man of loose character-3 and
one of the Scholiasta (Comm. Cruq.) there
calls him a ⁸ Juriaconsultus,'—probably in-
vented, Estre says, from the word ‘ judice,'
though no two worda could be much more
different in meaning. But there is nothing

certain by which the two can be identi-

15. St· φάε Deum] This is not a Roman
Ῡὲἶ, ἓξὲῗοᾟοῗὶἑῗῗὲξῗ ὲᾝὲἵ ἱζξέ
is absolute: ‘Here am 1.’ ‘Eia' is an
exclamation of haste, ⁴ Away l’ ⁴ Nolint,'
‘they would not' (eim ἐθέλοιεν ἄν), is the
apodosis to ⁴ si quis Deus.' Compare S. ii.
7. 242 ‘⁴ Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat,
usque recuses.” A small number of MSS.
and editions have ⁶ nolunt,’ which is clearly
wrong. ‘ Atqui ' is another form of ⁴ at-
quin‚’ and ‘quin’ represents ‘qui‚' with a
ῃθὲῗῗιῗνὲἰῗευθὲῑὲἓέθὲιβεί] An obvious
but not very reverential representation of
pas-on. Heindorf quotes Dem. de F. 1..
p. 442: διὰ τῆς ἀγορᾶς πορεύεται θοιμά-
τιον καθεὶς ἀχρὶ τῶν σφυρῶν, ἶσα βαίνων
Πυθόκλει, τὰς γνάθους υσῶν.

27. Sed tamen amoto ‘ Sed: ⁶ sed ta-
men,' · veruntamen ’ are often used, and
especially by Cicero, not to express opposi-
tion but after a parenthesis or dign-esaion,
as here and C. iv. 4. 22. See for another
instance among many, Cic. in Verr. (ii. 3.
2): ‘⁸ Atque ego plns oneris habeo quam qui
ceteros accusarunt (ai id onus appellandum
quod cum laetitia feras et voluptate) verun-
tamep hoc ego amplius suscepi qnam ce-
teri.

28. Ille yravem] The cause of that dis-
content which was spoken of at the begin-
ning is here traced to the love of money,
each man thinking that his neighbour is
getting it faster than he is. and wishing
therefore to change places with him. But
