It has been argued from ‘vidimus’ thst
Horace wrote of what he had seen, and
therefore the prodigies could not be those
at Caessr’s death. But this is not worth
listening to. Horace means thst his gene-
ration had seen the prodigies he refers tn,

unde] 44 its wsters driven violently back
from its mouth st the shore of the Etruscan
sea.” So 1 am inclined to take it with
Orelli, Dillenbr„ und others. Some take
4 Littore Etrusco' for the Etruscan or right
bank of the river, ss opposed to‘ sinis(tra rips'
(v. 18). ‘Littus’ is nsedfor‘ n'pa' (ss For-
cell. shews) by Virgil, ιι4 ripa ιι used for

'‘littus' by Horace (C. iii. 27. 24). Βιιι4 lit-
tus Etruscum' means the shore of the Etrus-
oen sesin θαι-ιιι. Sacc. 38, Epod. xvi. 4⁰, and
4 retortis ’ csn only signify driven back, and
that must be from the mouth. Moreover the
notiou of the reflux of the river seems ιο
have been common. Fen remarks that the
overflowings of the 'liber are still by the

That this is an old opinion we learn from

the statement of Seneca, quoted by Mitsch„
ιο the efl'ect that a river suddenly overflows

its banks 44 si crebrioribus ventis ostium

15. monumenta reqis] This significo the
palsce of Numa adjoining the temple of
Vesta, hencecslled‘ atrium re gi’um (Liv.
xxvi. 27), ss forming a kind οἰ· gleti-ium' to
the temple. Ovid (Fasti, vi. 263) thus al-
ludes to this building. —

Fea says thst the church of Sta. Maris
Liberatrice stands on this spot, and that it
is proved by certain inscriptions of the
Vestal Virgins found there ιιι the beginning
of the fisteenth century.

17. Iziae— ultorem] Tiber is repre-
sented as taking gupon himself without the
sanction of Jove, and in consequence of
111ιί complaints, ιο svenge the death of
Julius Caesar the descendant of Iulus.
Ilia or Res Sylvia (ss Niebuhr. 1. 111, says
the nsme is to be written and not Rhea)
was said by Ennius, according to the
Scholisst Porphyrion, to have been thrown
into the Tiber by command of Amulius,
and for this reason she is represented ss
married to that river, though she had been
previously betrothed to the Anio, ιο whom
ovid marries her (Amor. ι11. 6. 45, sqq„ s
