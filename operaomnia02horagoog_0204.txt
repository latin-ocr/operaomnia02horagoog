CARMINUM III. 15.

179

ARGUMENT.

Put a stop to thy intrigues3 for thou art old aud poor, a cloud among bright atara, ready
to drop into thy grave. What beeometh thy daughter becometh not thee, Chloris.

She may go and beniege the young men’a doors: she is in love and eannot help it.
But do thou go apin 3 music and flowers and wine are not for thee.

Uxor. pauperis Ibyci,

Tandem nequitiae fige modum tuae

F amosisque laboribus :

Maturo propior desine funeri

Inter ludere virgines

Et stellis nebulam spargere candidis,
Non si quid Pholoen satis

Et te, Chlori, decet:

filia rectius

Expugnat juvenum domOS,

Pulso Thyias uti concita tympano,
Illam cogit amor Nothi

10

Lascivae similem ludere capreae:

Te lanae prope nobilem

Tonsae Luceriam, non citharae decent,

N ec flos purpureus rosae

15

N ee poti vetulam faece tenus cadi.

1. pauperis] He means to say a poor
man’a wife should be thrifty and mind her
work, especially if she be old. For ‘ fige ’
nome lMSS. have ‘ pone,’ which Orelli says
is a g ose.

6. Et stellis nebulam] An old woman in
a company of girls would be like a cloud in
a stu-ry sky. On the elegy of Tibullus
mentioned before (C. i. 33. 7.) Heyne has
the following note, which Buttmann calls
incomprehensible (unbegreiflich) ι “ Pholoe
inter claras ejus aetatis puellas etiam ex Ho-
ratio nota est ubi, C. i. 33. 7, aspera puella
Cyrum fastidit alium mollem puerum, et
ii. 5. 17 est ea Pholoe . Chloridis eam
filiam fuisse idem Horatius colligere jubet
noe, iii. 15. 7, 8.” The first of these Pho-
lo& is a virtuons girl who would ὅσοι-ιι the
advanees os a profligate like Cyrus. The
secondiaatimid girl as her title ‘fugax'
shows. She ia also eoupled with a young
Chloris, aa handsome aa herself. The Pho-
Ιοὸ of this ode ia the wauton daughter of a

wauton old mother, Chloris by name. But
Heyne and others eonfound all these per·
sons. Such, as Buttmann has very well
shown, are the inoonsisteneies of the matter-
of-fact school of interpretem.

10. tympana] There are two good wood-
cuts, one from a painting at Pompeii, the
other from a fictile vaso, representing the
pse of §he tympanum in smith' s Dict. Ant.

14. Luceriam] Thia was a town opr u-
lia, now called Lucere, inthe neighbourhood
of which was one of the largest tracta of
publio pastui-e land.

16. vetulam] Many good MSS. have
‘vetulass and in support of that reading,
which some editors have adopted, ia quoted
Catullus (xxvii. l):· ‘Minister vetuli, puer,
Falerni! ' But· vetula’ would be without
soree here. Porphyrion, however, read* ve-
tula) The ⁶ m’ may have dropped out in tho
usual l:ray from the omission of the mark
