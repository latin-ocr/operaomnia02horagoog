SATIRARUM Ι. 6.

Sed puerum est ausus Romam portare docendum
Artes quas doceat quivis eques atque senator

Semet prognatos.

Vestem servosque sequentes,

In magno ut popu10, si qui vidisset, avita

Maiore quisquam circulo coronetur.
Albae Leone flammeo calent luces
Tostamque fervens Julius coquit messem.
Cirrata loris horridis Scythae pellis

Qua vapulavit Marsyas Celaenaus,
Ferulaeque tristes sceptra paedagogorum
Cessent et Idus dormiant iu Octobres.
Aestate pueri si valent satis discunt.”

From this it is inferred that it was an
exception to the mle if schools were not
closed during the summer months. That
these months were four is not stated by
Martial, and for au uuinterrupted vacation
any body will see that it is excessivo. There
are commentatore (Torrentius, Zeuui, and
others), who suppose that ⁴ referentes aera '
means not bringing with them their school-
fee, but calculatiug, according to exercises
given them by the master, sums of interest
(which the Romans peid on the Ides).
⁴ Referentes ' they suppose to be eutering
in these tables. Torrentius also affirms that
the schoolmaster's stipend was paid him
annually, because Juvenal says (vii. 242, sq.) ι

“,flaec inquit, cures et cum se verterit
Ααξιῗιὲωνὶοίισή populus quod postulat,
· aurum!

But the practice may have varied even in
Horace's time, aud still more between
Horace's and Juvenal's. Iu the absence
of any decided authority (Martial’s is vague)
as to any specific practice about holida ys
or day of payment, 1 am inclined to think
’ octonis Idibus ’ must be merely a peri-
phrasis for ‘Idibus.’ ‘Aera' is used by
Juvenal for the tescher's fee (“ Minus est
autem quam rhetoris aera,”) aud in that
sense Ι take it, uot with Torrentius. To
emme from Juvenal (x. ll7, quoted in last
note) that the regular payment at oue of
these cheap schools was an‘ as, ’and that

‘'aera is equivalent to ‘assem' is un-
warrsnted. The‘ as 'there referredtowas
the Minerval, 8 voluutas-y offering presented
by each scholar ω his master at the Quiu-
quatria, the festival of Minerva. The tet-ms
no doubt varied, though they must have
been low at this Venusiau school, aud at all,
compared with those of modern days.

76. Sed puerum est aune] At what
age Horace was seut to Rome he does not

inform us. But it is probable he went when
he was twelve years old.

77. Artes quae doceat] Iu the earlier
days of Roman history the education of 8
boy was of the simplest kind, consisting
chiefly of reading, writing, and arithmetic.
’ calculator ' and ’ notarius ' continued un-
til the time of Martini to be names for
8 εοὴοοὶιιιιιειεις and, as observed before
(v. 72, ιι..) the majority of boys learnt
little more thau the above even in Horaee' s
time. When Cicero was a boy tho learning
of the twelve tables formed 8 necessary part
of educatiou (Leg ii. 23). “Discebamus
enim pueri duodecim ut carmen necessarium,
2¹33 &mm ”⁶¹13 dgffi‘gm{‘²g„;¹;⁸2¹·f⁰⁰fffi;
brought a more liberal class ot studies to
Rome, where Horace says he studied

Homer (Epp. ii. 2. 41, sq.) :—

” Romae nutriri mihi contigit atque doceri
Iratus Graiis quantum nocuisset Achilles.”

Rhetoric was 8 brauoh of study much
pursued by the young Romans3 poetry
likewise, and the philosophy of Greece.
Their studies comment-ed at 88 early age,
at first under the teachiug of their ’ paeda-
gogi,’ aud asterwards (tin they assumed the

‘toga virilis,’ aud in some cases longer) at
the ‘ludi literariiss private schools which
they attended as day scholare. The‘ paeda-
gogusss whose office was of late growth at
Rome aud borrowed from Greece, had the
same functione as the παιδαγωγός among
the Greeks, and was 8 slave as there. He
was contiuually about the boy’s person, and
went with him to his masters. This task
Horace's father, who could have had but
few slaves, aud had none whom he could
trust with such important duties, performed
himself. Besides the ‘paedagogum' as ob.
served above (v. 74, 8.), other slaves went
with the boy to carry his bag, δια, aud to
give him consequence.

79.1n mayno ut populo, ] The meaning
of this is variously given. “‘As ιε proper in

crowdss' is Orelli' s interpretation and Hein-
dorfs. Doeriug is divided between the two.
1 am not clear upon the point, but 1 incline
to Heindorl's opinion. On the construction,
