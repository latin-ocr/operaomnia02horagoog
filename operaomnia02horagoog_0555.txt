HORATII FLAGOI

Romanoque habitu, prodis ex judice Dama

Turpis, odoratum caput obscurante lacerna,

Non ee quod simulas? Metuens induceris atque
Altercante libidinibus tremis ossa pavore.

Quid refert uri, virgis ferroque necari
Auctoratus eae, an turpi clausus in arca,

Quo te demisit peccati conscia herilia,

Contractum genibus tangas caput? Estne marito
Matronae peccantis in ambo justa potestas!

In corruptorem vel justior.

Illa tamen ae

Non habitu mutatve loc0, peccatve superne.

but here that gai-ment (⁴ &manus habitus ⁹)
is laid aeide. The man's hair ἰι scented with
perfumed eil, like ‘Varus' in Epod. v. 59.
See Epp. i. 14. 32, ιι.

59. Auctoratus eam] Though gladiatore
were for the most part slaves or uiminals,
freemen sometimes sold their services in
this capacity, and they were ealled‘ aucto·
rati,⁹ and the pay they received· auctora-
mentum! So Suetonius says that 'fiberius
exhibited gladiatorial shows to the memory
of Augustus, and Drusus his grandfather,
and to ina-ease the number he hired several
who had received their discharge,⁴ ‘rudiariis
quoque quibusdam revocatis auctoramento
centenum millium⁹⁹ (vit. Tib. c. vii..) Such
persons bound themselves by a v strin-
gent bond to the· lanista⁹ who λ· them.
The words of this bond are given in a
passage of Pon-oniuw·1n verba Eumolpi sa·
mmentum juravimus uri, vinei1i,verbera1i,
ferroque necari, et quicquid aliud Eumolpus
jussisset, tanquam legitimi gladiatores do·
mino corpora animasque religiosissime ad-
dicimus.⁹⁹ The same words Seneca quotes
(Ep. 87)=⁴⁴1'romisisti virum bonum, saera·
mento obligatus es. —Eadem honestissimi
hujus et illius turpissimi auctoramenti verba
sunt uri, vinciri, ferroque necari· ⁹⁹ and this
explains Juvenal⁹ s “Scriptums leges et
regia verba lanistae’ ⁹.(S xi. 8). The word
is said to be derived from ‘sueton' iu the
sense of 4 venditor-⁹ from the person selling
his services, that being a particular sense of
4 auctor ⁹ as opposed to 4 emtor.⁹ There· ιι
evidently a connexion between the two
words,hutitisnot easyto seewhat it is·
for ‘auctor ⁹ is only applied to the seller as
warranting the titleae--From the above pu·
sagos it is clear that 4 uri ⁹ is absolute 3 it does

Juvenal (iii. 49 t ι· ouis nunc diligitu’r nisi
cunsdusP’ 4 ιιιοίιιι’ means an weom-

plice. The man aska what Muenna it
makes whether a freernan goes and leta
himself to a ‘lanista' to be beaten and
tortured at his viu, or runs the risk, in
furtheranee of his amours‚ of being shut up
head and heels together in a ditty old cheat
by his misti-ess' s slave-girl, to keep out of
the way of her husband.

61. Estne mas-ito] What were the pro-
visions of the laws respeeiing adulter! re-
pealedbythe Julia lex, passed afflue 737
οι· thereabouts (C. iv. ὅ. 21), is not known.
That they affected the wife' ι ‘dos' we have
mainetii. 131 Gellius: ,23) quotes
a s of the elder Cato,‘ Dote‚⁹⁹ by
which it appears that the husband had then

wer to put his wife to death if he caught

erintheactofadultery, audifsohe
must have had that power at the time
Horace wrote, for the law had not been
altered. The words of Cato, who died lac.
149, are these. “Vir quum divortium fecit
mulieri judex pro censore est. Imperium
quod videtur habet. Si quid perverse tetre-
que factum est a muliere, multatur: si
vinum bibit, si cum alieno viro probri qud
feeit, condemnatur. —In adulterio uxorem
tuam si deprehendisses sine judicio impune
necares. Illa te si adulterares digito non
auderet contingam neque jus est? This
Davus would eall lhard measure against
women· “lEcastor egedura vivunt mu-
lieres⁹⁹ (Plautus, Men-cat. iv. 5. 3). The
partiality which Davus· words imply was
corrected hythe above law of Aug-ustus,
which gave the husband power to kin the
adulterer in certain maes, hut not ω kin
hiswife. lt· ιι elearfrom this Satire and
the second of the first book that the injured
husband might do pretty much as he pleased,
or was able, to revenge himself on the adul-
terer, without sear of the lawa.
